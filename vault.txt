Title: Iran diplomatic initiative: OIC set to hold emergency meeting on Trump’s Gaza plot Datetime: 20250212_071200 Content: The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is reportedly to hold an emergency meeting of its foreign ministers in response to an Iranian diplomatic initiative, to address the US's “plans” for forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had engaged in extensive diplomatic outreach over the recent days, holding discussions with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Gambia, which currently holds the OIC’s rotating presidency.In an official letter to the OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, the top diplomat said he had outlined the urgency of convening the meeting to discuss and counter colonial efforts to forcibly relocate the Gaza Strip’s Palestinian population.
Iran's proposal has garnered widespread support from the OIC member states, and the meeting is expected to take place in a few days' time, an IRNA correspondent reported on Wednesday citing an informed source at the Iranian Foreign Ministry. The Islamic Republic’s initiative follows US President Donald Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s either announcing or advocating for forced exodus of Gazans to countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and even Saudi Arabia.Tehran has urged unity among Muslim nations and a collective stance against such measures."The forced displacement ‘plan’ is a continuation of colonial efforts to erase Palestine," Araghchi warned, emphasizing the need for immediate and decisive international action.
He further condemned "a blatant attempt to normalize genocide and lawlessness by the occupying regime." The official also denounced recent statements by the Israeli prime minister, who suggested “establishment of a Palestinian state within Saudi territory.” Araghchi called these remarks "an unprecedented display of aggression by the occupying regime and a serious threat to regional peace and security." Reaffirming the necessity of collective action, he urged the OIC to take significant steps towards confronting the joint US-Israeli scheme. "The international community, particularly regional and Islamic nations, must implement urgent measures to prevent the legitimization of these criminal acts," he stated.Observers say the upcoming OIC meeting will serve as a crucial platform for member states to coordinate their response to the escalating crisis and reinforce their support for Palestinian sovereignty.

Title: Iran condemns litany of hostile US actions, calls out Washington's hypocrisy Datetime: 20250212_211100 Content: The Iranian Foreign Ministry has released a fact sheet featuring the United States long list of historically hostile actions towards the Islamic Republic, denouncing Washington’s hypocritical approach towards the country.The ministry released the fact sheet, which included a whole host of US violations concerning Iran, such as reinstatement of its so-called “maximum pressure” policy towards the Islamic Republic, on Wednesday.The US initiated the policy under Donald Trump’s former tenure as president and relaunched it under his current incumbency, with the American chief executive signing a new “Presidential National Security Memorandum” on February 4, through which he ordered intensification of economic and political pressure against the Islamic Republic.
The ministry described the policy as an extension of Washington’s long-standing adversarial attitude towards Tehran. It, meanwhile, asserted that “maximum pressure” was never truly halted after Trump’s former term wound down, as the previous US administration of Joe Biden not only retained the country’s sanctions against Iran, but also imposed hundreds more.The ministry reiterated the Islamic Republic’s commitment to resisting such coercive measures, emphasizing that no nation should be subjected to illegal and unjust economic pressure.‘Dual approach exposes US hypocrisy’ The US was deploying the policy, while simultaneously calling for negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue, the ministry said, noting that such attitude contradicted Washington’s rhetoric.Iran underlines that it has always supported diplomacy and engaged in negotiations in good faith.
However, it reminds at the same time that pressure and intimidation tactics have never yielded results as far as dealing with the Islamic Republic is concerned. Iranian authorities, meanwhile, warn that such contradictory approach only deepens distrust and undermines any possibility of meaningful diplomatic engagement.US’s breach of nuclear deal The fact sheet further highlighted the United States track record regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement backed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which was signed between Iran and world countries, including the US, in 2015.The former Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 in a unilateral and illegal move, despite its endorsement by the UNSC.It then returned the sanctions that the accord had lifted, and ramped up even more economic pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Washington's departure came despite Iran’s full compliance with the agreement as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the document highlighted. “Over the past four years, despite intensive negotiations to revive the JCPOA, Washington, while expressing a desire to return to the agreement, has never been willing to fulfill its JCPOA commitments or lift sanctions against the Iranian nation, and under various pretexts, it prevented, on different occasions, the negotiations from reaching a final conclusion,” it added.Historical US hostility towards Iran The document also recalled the long history of other aggressive American actions against Iran, dating back to the CIA-orchestrated 1953 coup.It listed numerous examples, including Washington’s military support and other instances of backing for former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980-88 imposed war on Iran, freezing of Iranian assets, and military provocations.
It also reminded the US’s ordering the assassination of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s former top anti-terror commander and a strongly revered national and regional personality, in early 2020, and its facilitating the targeting of Iranian nuclear scientists by the Israeli regime -- which has so far assassinated at least seven of the scientists. Washington’s role in regional instability Additionally, the fact sheet challenged US allegations that Iran supported “terrorism,” asserting that the Islamic Republic was, in fact, the primary victim of terrorism in the region.It pointed to the sacrifices that had been made by Iranian servicemen in the fight against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region and other similar outfits.Meanwhile, the ministry reiterated Iran’s condemnation of the US’s fueling regional instability by backing groups like Daesh, al-Qaeda, and al-Nusra Front, currently Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, to serve its geopolitical interests.
Furthermore, the statement argued that Washington would try to brand Iran’s continued support for regional resistance movements, which fight against deadly Israeli occupation and aggression, as fostering “terrorism” as a pretext to shield the Israeli regime from accountability for its atrocities against the regional peoples, including members of the resistance factions. “Labeling Iran's support for resistance groups and Muslim nations in the region - who are fighting for the liberation of their land and human dignity against an occupying regime - as "support for terrorism" does not change the reality,” it underlined.“Blaming the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a futile US attempt to protect the Zionist regime from accountability and to evade from US responsibility for full-fledged and absolute support for the crimes of this regime,” it added, pointing to Washington’s all-out political, military, and intelligence support for Tel Aviv’s military aggression.
US human rights violations, economic warfare The ministry also condemned Washington’s claims of championing human rights, highlighting its full support for Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip and the devastation that had been caused by economic sanctions on the Iranian people. It reminded that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US even intensified its sanctions, worsening humanitarian conditions in Iran, and asserted that the American policies directly targeted the Iranian people, contradicting Washington’s self-proclaimed concern for human rights.Iran’s response: Diplomacy with strength, dignity Amid the American attitude, Iran’s leadership, guided by the principles of “dignity, wisdom, and expediency,” would refuse to negotiate under pressure, the document underscored.Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has reiterated that engaging in talks under coercion was irrational and would undermine Iran’s sovereignty.
Tehran, however, remains open to diplomacy that safeguards its national interests. While committed to diplomatic solutions, Iran warns that any aggression against its national security would be met with a decisive response, the ministry stressed, pledging to continue pursuing the Islamic Republic’s interests from a position of strength, and ensuring that the country’s sovereignty and regional stability remained non-negotiable.The ministry finally reaffirmed that Iran has never pursued acquiring nuclear weapons, citing a binding religious decree (fatwa) against such prospect that had been issued by the Leader.It called on the US, the only country to have ever deployed nuclear weapons, to refrain from using the nuclear issue as an excuse for confrontation.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk

Title: Leader: Iranians sent ‘message of unity’ to world on Revolution anniv.amid enemy’s stupid threats Datetime: 20250212_090400 Content: Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has commended the Iranian nation for relaying its “message of unity” to the international community on the 46th anniversary of the country’s historic 1979 Islamic Revolution.Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in Tehran on Wednesday, addressing a gathering of Defense Ministry officials, defense industry elites, the ministry’s experts and staff, and families of the martyrs hailing from the country’s defense industry.The Leader described the day marking the Revolution’s victory as one of the most significant national events, showcasing the unity and strength of the Iranian people despite relentless external pressures.Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized that the celebrations on this year’s anniversary were not just a commemoration, but a powerful act of resistance and national unity.
"This was a message of unity from the Iranian people. Despite the constant, idiotic threats against us, the people of Iran showed the world their identity, their strength, and their unwavering resolve.” "This year’s February 22nd was one of the most outstanding celebrations of the Revolution," the Leader stated."It was a popular uprising, a grand national movement.People took to the streets, raised their voices, and shared their views across the media, all over the country.
This was a true popular uprising, a major national movement." Ayatollah Khamenei noted that, "Despite ongoing media bombardments, psychological warfare, and unfounded threats from adversaries against the historic development, the Iranian people stood strong in their commitment to the values of the Revolution with their indication of strong support for the event during this year’s marches and jubilations." Ayatollah Khamenei also made special reference to the presence of young people in the celebrations, their vibrant energy, which was visible across the country’s various cities, not just in Tehran and major urban centers, but in remote towns and villages. Even in cities where the weather was harsh and conditions unfavorable, millions of Iranians participated, demonstrating their collective will, the Leader remarked.
According to observers, Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments reflect the broader sentiment in Iran, where the Revolution’s anniversary has become a symbol of resistance against foreign interference and a reaffirmation of Iran’s sovereignty. The anniversary also serves as a reminder of the enduring influence of the Revolution, despite the ongoing political and economic challenges posed by the country’s adversaries, they note.Leader visits defense industry exhibition Ayatollah Khamenei said, “The issue of defending the nation, defending security, is not a small matter.Today, Iran's defensive power is renowned and well-known.Iran's friends take pride in this defensive power, and Iran's enemies fear it.This is very important for a nation, for a country.” Also on Wednesday, the Leader visited the Eqtedar (Strength) 1403 Exhibition, which showcased the latest achievements and capabilities of Iran’s defense industry.
The event displayed advanced equipment and new technologies used in areas such as air defense, ballistic and cruise missiles, smart munitions, space, drones, aviation, vessels, and energy. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran seeks deeper ties with Turkmenistan: President Pezeshkian Datetime: 20250212_154000 Content: Iran has historically sought to expand friendly relations with Turkmenistan and supports the expansion of cooperation across different sectors, says President Masoud Pezeshkian.In a meeting with Turkmenistan's Foreign Minister Avazgeldyevich Meredov in Tehran, the Iranian president said the "necessary orders have been issued to the relevant authorities to examine the areas of further cooperation with the government of Turkmenistan." The Iranian president underscored the removal of obstacles for accelerating the implementation of joint projects.Pezeshkian also pointed to an upcoming meeting of the Caspian Sea littoral states in Tehran, and added that Iran seeks to expand relations among Caspian countries based on peace, friendship, and good neighborliness.
"The Islamic Republic of Iran wants to expand relations among the Caspian countries based on peace, friendship, and good neighborliness, and this approach will be raised in the upcoming Caspian summit with an emphasis on achieving practical solutions for the development of cooperation." During this meeting, Meredov praised agreements between Iranian and Turkmen companies in fields like transportation and energy, and called for broader cooperation between Iran and Turkmenistan across all sectors. Meredov also expressed hope that holding a Joint Commission for Economic Cooperation would enhance economic ties between both nations."Relations between the two countries are of great importance to the government of Turkmenistan, and we want to expand relations between the two countries in all fields," he said.Palestine, Afghanistan situation discussed Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also held talks with his counterpart from Turkmenistan.
After their meeting, he hailed the "very deep" ties between the two countries due to their shared cultural heritage. In the meeting, Araghchi said they exchanged views regarding regional issues and developments in West Asia, including Palestine's situation."We are against forced displacement affecting the Palestinian people; it contradicts international principles as well as humanity’s values." Araghchi noted that "good consultations" were also held about Afghanistan during their session.Both parties agreed on the need to increase consultations regarding international issues alongside bilateral matters, according to Araghchi."We are trying to expand the relations between Iran and Turkmenistan as much as possible and in line with the interests of the two countries."

Title: Iran condemns litany of hostile US actions, calls out Washington's hypocrisy Datetime: 20250212_211100 Content: The Iranian Foreign Ministry has released a fact sheet featuring the United States long list of historically hostile actions towards the Islamic Republic, denouncing Washington’s hypocritical approach towards the country.The ministry released the fact sheet, which included a whole host of US violations concerning Iran, such as reinstatement of its so-called “maximum pressure” policy towards the Islamic Republic, on Wednesday.The US initiated the policy under Donald Trump’s former tenure as president and relaunched it under his current incumbency, with the American chief executive signing a new “Presidential National Security Memorandum” on February 4, through which he ordered intensification of economic and political pressure against the Islamic Republic.
The ministry described the policy as an extension of Washington’s long-standing adversarial attitude towards Tehran. It, meanwhile, asserted that “maximum pressure” was never truly halted after Trump’s former term wound down, as the previous US administration of Joe Biden not only retained the country’s sanctions against Iran, but also imposed hundreds more.The ministry reiterated the Islamic Republic’s commitment to resisting such coercive measures, emphasizing that no nation should be subjected to illegal and unjust economic pressure.‘Dual approach exposes US hypocrisy’ The US was deploying the policy, while simultaneously calling for negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue, the ministry said, noting that such attitude contradicted Washington’s rhetoric.Iran underlines that it has always supported diplomacy and engaged in negotiations in good faith.
However, it reminds at the same time that pressure and intimidation tactics have never yielded results as far as dealing with the Islamic Republic is concerned. Iranian authorities, meanwhile, warn that such contradictory approach only deepens distrust and undermines any possibility of meaningful diplomatic engagement.US’s breach of nuclear deal The fact sheet further highlighted the United States track record regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement backed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which was signed between Iran and world countries, including the US, in 2015.The former Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 in a unilateral and illegal move, despite its endorsement by the UNSC.It then returned the sanctions that the accord had lifted, and ramped up even more economic pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Washington's departure came despite Iran’s full compliance with the agreement as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the document highlighted. “Over the past four years, despite intensive negotiations to revive the JCPOA, Washington, while expressing a desire to return to the agreement, has never been willing to fulfill its JCPOA commitments or lift sanctions against the Iranian nation, and under various pretexts, it prevented, on different occasions, the negotiations from reaching a final conclusion,” it added.Historical US hostility towards Iran The document also recalled the long history of other aggressive American actions against Iran, dating back to the CIA-orchestrated 1953 coup.It listed numerous examples, including Washington’s military support and other instances of backing for former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980-88 imposed war on Iran, freezing of Iranian assets, and military provocations.
It also reminded the US’s ordering the assassination of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s former top anti-terror commander and a strongly revered national and regional personality, in early 2020, and its facilitating the targeting of Iranian nuclear scientists by the Israeli regime -- which has so far assassinated at least seven of the scientists. Washington’s role in regional instability Additionally, the fact sheet challenged US allegations that Iran supported “terrorism,” asserting that the Islamic Republic was, in fact, the primary victim of terrorism in the region.It pointed to the sacrifices that had been made by Iranian servicemen in the fight against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region and other similar outfits.Meanwhile, the ministry reiterated Iran’s condemnation of the US’s fueling regional instability by backing groups like Daesh, al-Qaeda, and al-Nusra Front, currently Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, to serve its geopolitical interests.
Furthermore, the statement argued that Washington would try to brand Iran’s continued support for regional resistance movements, which fight against deadly Israeli occupation and aggression, as fostering “terrorism” as a pretext to shield the Israeli regime from accountability for its atrocities against the regional peoples, including members of the resistance factions. “Labeling Iran's support for resistance groups and Muslim nations in the region - who are fighting for the liberation of their land and human dignity against an occupying regime - as "support for terrorism" does not change the reality,” it underlined.“Blaming the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a futile US attempt to protect the Zionist regime from accountability and to evade from US responsibility for full-fledged and absolute support for the crimes of this regime,” it added, pointing to Washington’s all-out political, military, and intelligence support for Tel Aviv’s military aggression.
US human rights violations, economic warfare The ministry also condemned Washington’s claims of championing human rights, highlighting its full support for Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip and the devastation that had been caused by economic sanctions on the Iranian people. It reminded that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US even intensified its sanctions, worsening humanitarian conditions in Iran, and asserted that the American policies directly targeted the Iranian people, contradicting Washington’s self-proclaimed concern for human rights.Iran’s response: Diplomacy with strength, dignity Amid the American attitude, Iran’s leadership, guided by the principles of “dignity, wisdom, and expediency,” would refuse to negotiate under pressure, the document underscored.Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has reiterated that engaging in talks under coercion was irrational and would undermine Iran’s sovereignty.
Tehran, however, remains open to diplomacy that safeguards its national interests. While committed to diplomatic solutions, Iran warns that any aggression against its national security would be met with a decisive response, the ministry stressed, pledging to continue pursuing the Islamic Republic’s interests from a position of strength, and ensuring that the country’s sovereignty and regional stability remained non-negotiable.The ministry finally reaffirmed that Iran has never pursued acquiring nuclear weapons, citing a binding religious decree (fatwa) against such prospect that had been issued by the Leader.It called on the US, the only country to have ever deployed nuclear weapons, to refrain from using the nuclear issue as an excuse for confrontation.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran slams US allegations against Tehran concerning Syria, condemns sanctions, Israeli violations Datetime: 20250212_231600 Content: Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations has strongly rejected the US’s accusations against the Islamic Republic of “destabilizing” Syria, calling them “baseless” and a deliberate distortion of reality aimed at misleading the international community.Addressing a UN Security Council session on Syria on Wednesday, Amir Saeid Iravani condemned Washington’s narrative, highlighting its own violations of the Syrian sovereignty under the pretext of counterterrorism.“The accusations made by the US representative against my country are completely unfounded,” he said.
“These claims are crafted solely to distort the truth and mislead the international community.” “The reality is that the United States has long violated Syria’s sovereignty, provided safe havens for terrorist groups, and supported Israel’s aggression—all in pursuit of its geopolitical ambitions.” The envoy was responding to remarks made by Deputy US Ambassador to the world body, Dorothy Shea, who had alleged that Iran “continued to back” militant groups inside Syria and was seeking to “reestablish its military presence” in the war-torn country. Iravani categorically dismissed the claims, emphasizing that Iran remained committed to Syria’s sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity.‘US sanctions hindering Syria’s recovery’ The high-ranking Iranian diplomat, meanwhile, turned the focus towards the humanitarian and economic crisis in Syria, criticizing the “unjust and unlawful” sanctions that had been imposed by the United States and the European Union against the Arab country.
He stressed that such extraterritorial measures were severely hindering Syria’s reconstruction efforts and disproportionately harming ordinary citizens. “Temporary relief or limited humanitarian exemptions are not a sustainable solution,” he said.“These illegal measures must be fully lifted to allow the Syrian people to rebuild their country and return to a life of dignity.” The ambassador also argued that the sanctions directly obstructed early recovery projects necessary for Syria’s long-term stability, adding that their removal was essential for safe and voluntary return of millions of displaced Syrians.On resurgence of terrorism in Syria Iravani further raised the issue of the growing threat of terrorism in Syria.He noted that “foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs)” and extremist groups interfering in the Arab country continued to pose a significant danger to both regional and global security.
“The risk of advanced weapons stockpiles falling into the hands of terrorists is real,” he warned, citing UN reports that an estimated 42,500 individuals with suspected ties to the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group -- which was vanquished by Syria and its allies, including Iran and Russia, in 2017 -- remained in detention camps in northeastern Syria. The official called for a structured and accountable process for repatriating these individuals to their home countries and holding them legally accountable.“Iran remains firmly committed to combating terrorism and is prepared to cooperate with legitimate international partners to address this critical challenge.” Condemnation of Israeli aggression Iravani also lambasted the Israeli regime’s ongoing violations of the Syrian sovereignty, denouncing Tel Aviv for systematically targeting the country’s military and research infrastructure with US backing.
“Israel continues to be a serious threat to Syria, repeatedly violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “Despite numerous Security Council resolutions, the regime refuses to withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights and instead expands its occupation.” Iravani, therefore, urged the Security Council to take decisive action against the Israeli aggression and to hold the regime accountable for its attacks on the Syrian territory.Call for political dialogue, Syrian-led future Reaffirming Iran’s stance on Syria’s future, Iravani stressed that only the Syrian people had to determine their country’s path, free from external interference.He reiterated the Islamic Republic’s support for formation of an inclusive government in Syria based on national dialog and proportional representation, with UN Resolution 2254 -- which called for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria in 2015 -- providing the necessary framework for constitutional reform.
“The future of Syria must be determined solely by its people,” he asserted. “Iran fully supports the formation of a government through free elections, ensuring a fair process that reflects the will of all Syrians.” Iran’s commitment to stability in Syria In conclusion, the Iranian ambassador reaffirmed the country’s role as a constructive partner in efforts to achieve lasting peace in Syria.He expressed full support for the UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen’s efforts and called for a greater international commitment to Syria’s reconstruction and stabilization.Iran remains dedicated to working in coordination with the United Nations and regional partners to achieve lasting peace and stability in Syria, Iravani stated.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Trump talks offer ‘part of maximum pressure’; US commitments ‘unfulfilled’: Leader’s aide Datetime: 20250213_080300 Content: A senior advisor to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the US contradictory approach towards Iran is part of Washington’s so-called maximum pressure policy and fails to reflect its genuine readiness to hold talks with Tehran.Ali Shamkhani said the US proposes holding dialogue with Iran but at the same time it intensifies sanctions against the country.Negotiation should be carried out at the proper time from a position of strength and with the aim of securing national interests, not as a solution to internal problems, he added.
He emphasized that negotiations would be meaningful only if both sides demonstrate the necessary will and capacity to reach a lasting agreement, but “experience provers that the US has not remained committed to its obligations.” The senior official once again reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to the talks to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite the US’ unilateral withdrawal. Shamkhani said Iran has not abandoned negotiations; rather, it is the United States and Europe that failed to live up to their commitments and must remove the sanctions imposed on the country.He criticized the US policies and its “unreliable” proposal for negotiation, adding that talks hinge on adoption of a logical and respectful approach on the part of the European signatories to the JCPOA.In case of any negotiation, Iran will only focus on the removal of sanctions and not a merely superficial and nonpractical agreement, he pointed out.
The Leader’s aide said any possible agreement or negotiations would not surely lead to the resolution of Iran’s economic problems, further explaining that the experience of the JCPOA and lack of commitment of the US and Europe have shown that relying solely on negotiations would not bear fruit. He stressed that structural reforms and proper economic governance are the main prerequisites for improving the country's situation.Shamkhani dismissed the “incorrect” view that negotiations would lead to an agreement that would solve economic problems.There have been many countries that, despite extensive economic agreements, continue to face economic crises due to weak domestic infrastructure, he explained.He stressed the importance of improving domestic foundations and reducing dependence on external variables to solve the country’s problems.In that case, Iran can enter any possible negotiations from a position of strength and not out of necessity, Shamkhani said.
He was echoing Ayatollah Khamenei’s remarks last week that experience has shown negotiations with the US have no effect on solving Iran's problems. "Some people pretend that if we sit at the negotiating table, some problems will be solved, but the fact that we must understand correctly is that negotiating with the US has no effect on solving the country's problems," the Leader stated.On February 6, the United States imposed its first set of sanctions on Iran after US President Donald Trump revived his so-called maximum pressure strategy against the Islamic Republic.The move came two days after Trump said he was willing to revive negotiations with Iran but signed an executive order, restoring his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk

..................60 User Guide jDFC Page 5 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document. 1.INTRODUCTION 1.1 Scope This document describes jDFC - the utility used to calibrate, tune, and troubleshoot the Flight Controls system on SimXXI-type simulators.1.2 Overview jDFC is used to calibrate, tune, and test both the hardware and software components of the Flight Controls system.It consists of several user-selectable pages that provide access to these various components.These are described in detail in section 3.1.3 Semantics “Clicking” on something means “using the left mouse button to click”.“Right-clicking” means “using the right-mouse button to click”.User Guide jDFC Page 6 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.2.
GENERAL 2.1 Interaction with the Flight Controls system When the jDFC icon is selected, another application that physically runs on the same computer as the Flight Controls application is started. This application, called MCLServer, handles the transfer of data between jDFC and the Flight Controls application software.jDFC uses the MCLServer application to get information about the system for display and to send requests to the application (to start a test, for example).As such, it is possible to start jDFC on a remote computer as long as a network connection can be established between the computer hosting the Flight Controls software and the remote computer running jDFC.2.2 jDFC layout Figure 1 - jDFC jDFC is divided into 4 main areas : • The menu area, located at the top of the utility, is used to navigate the utility and to select display pages .• The page area, located in the center of the utility, is where the pages selected in the menu area are displayed.
This area occupies about 80% of the utility’s window. User Guide jDFC Page 7 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.• The log windows area, located at the bottom of the utility, is used to display various error, warning, and status messages to the user.• The status area, located in the lower right-hand corner, displays the status of the various Flight Control nodes including the ON, OFF or FAILED status of the controls and the status of each Flight Controls process.These are the possible icons for each process: • M: indicates the “Master” process.• Green square wave: indicates that the process is synchronized with the IEEE 1394 communication (if applicable) • Green square: process is running.• Red square: process is failed or not communicating.• Black square: process status is unknown.Two horizontal bars are displayed in the lower portion of this area.
The first bar displays the communication rate between jDFC and the MCLServer application in characters per second. This visual cue shows that the utility is connected to its server counterpart.When the cursor is placed above the bar, a tool tip appears, providing more information on the communication.The second bar displays the amount of memory (in megabytes) that the utility is using.2.3 Monitor component Most of the pages in jDFC are built using a component called a Monitor .This component allows the user to read (and, when applicable, write) the value of a specific variable (e.g.a load unit current).A monitor is Read-Only when its value is displayed using a plain font, and Read-Write when its value is displayed using a bold font.A small dot in the upper right quadrant of a variable field indicates that it is saved in the data file.Additionally, placing the cursor above any monitor for a short time causes a tool tip1 to appear.
A tool tip is a pop-up window that displays additional information on the monitor (the full variable name, the monitoring frequency, etc). Figure 2 - A group of Read-Only monitors with a tool tip displayed Figure 3 - A group of Read-Write monitors (bold), one of them in Edit mode Clicking on a Read-Write monitor activates its Edit mode.A text box appears that allows the user to type in a numerical entry.To confirm the new entry, the user can do one of the following: • Hit <enter> on the keyboard.• Click anywhere else in the utility.1 This feature is also present on other graphical components of the utility User Guide jDFC Page 8 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.• Press any arrow key to go to a neighboring monitor (which then activates its Edit mode).To cancel Edit mode, the user can do one of the following: • Hit <esc> on the keyboard.
• Delete the content of the text box and “confirm” (since this is an invalid input, no action will be taken by the monitor) Monitors also support Drag-and-Drop operations. When a Monitor is dragged into another application that also supports this operation, the user can actually transfer the variable name of the Monitor into that application.Monitors can also be dropped in the utility’s own textboxes (found in the Misc Monitoring page, the Quick List, the Scope, etc…) to avoid having to retype the variable’s name.Additionally, every monitor can be right-clicked whereupon a popup menu appears and allows the user to choose among at least two menu items.More menu items are sometimes available depending on the context of the page containing the monitor.The following sub-sections describe each popup item.Figure 4 - A monitor's right-click popup menu 2.3.1 Magnify Enlarges the selected monitor element in a new window.
Resizing this window also resizes the monitor, allowing the user to see the value from a greater distance, aiding in tasks where the display is out of reach. Figure 5 - A magnified monitor 2.3.2 Plot Real-time This function plots the value of a monitor element over time at a sampling frequency of up to 60 Hz.Note that this rate is not synchronized with the simulation (as opposed to CTS).Additional Monitors can be dragged-and-dropped in a plot.User Guide jDFC Page 9 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.Figure 6 - Real-time plotting 2.3.3 Copy label to ClipBoard This function copies the label name of the Monitor into the system clipboard.This is useful for the user who wishes to perform a search in a separate application (typically a text editor displaying a software module).2.3.4 Change Color This function is used to change the display color of the Monitor.
This is useful to the user who is frequently looking back and forth between the utility and another location and wants to quickly “zero-in” on the Monitor of interest.

When the item is selected, a dialog box opens and prompts the user for a filename and comment. The information is also saved in the data file.3.1.3 Exit This selection closes the utility without saving any values.User Guide jDFC Page 11 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.3.2 DBU Terminals Menu This menu allows users to connect to the terminal utility of any DBU connected to the system.When a DBU is selected, a separate window opens and a software emulation of the DBU terminal utility appears.This feature is an alternative to physically connecting a display terminal via an RS232 cable to the cPDSP3u on the DBU.The window also has its own menu that allows the user to connect to a different DBU.Only one terminal window to a single DBU can be opened at a time.
DBUs must be powered, have a correct and unique node identification, have the CONTROL system setting and properly connected to the 1394 bus so that they are available in the pull down list (these are discussed in the following sections). Figure 8 - DBU Terminals menu 3.2.1 DBU Utilities Menu This is the main menu page of the DBU terminals utility.The software version number is shown on the right-hand side of the title box.The Node identification number as defined on the DBU back-plane I-button appears in the lower right-hand corner of the page.The elapsed time since the DBU was powered up is also displayed in the lower right-hand corner (in hours, minutes, and seconds).The cursor, indicated by a highlighted (reverse video) field, can be moved to any menu page selection by using the UP and DOWN arrow keys on the keyboard.Pressing the enter key while a menu item is highlighted causes that selected page to appear.
Alternately, the page name can be typed followed by pressing the enter key.

These tests are explained in further detail in later sections of this document. Figure 20 - Tests menu These tests include: • Automatic computation of force offset and friction • Plot of actuator friction and force offset • Automatic computation of servo controller parameters o force feed-forward o inertial compensation • Bode frequency sweeps for actuator testing (gain and phase plots) • Flight control measurement for automated calibration of : o position o force o compliance • ELU encoder and motor commutation offsets User Guide jDFC Page 32 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.3.4 Tools Menu This menu regroups various tools that can be used to troubleshoot the system.Figure 21 - Tools menu 3.4.1 Generic Monitor Popup This menu item brings up a separate window containing Generic Monitors (see section 4.7 for more details).
This feature is similar to the Misc Monitoring page (see section 4.7) but can be used while another page is displayed. This feature eliminates the need to switch back and forth between the page of interest and the Misc Monitoring page.Users can add or remove additional Generic Monitors as they require by pressing the + or - buttons.Figure 22 - Generic Monitor window 3.4.2 Debug Helper Figure 23 - Debug window The ‘debug helper’ window provides access to the Bode User test parameters, allowing the user to specify the drive signal destination [e.g.position, velocity and acceleration of the servo control] User Guide jDFC Page 33 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.and the bode utility input variables used to compute phase and gain information.To properly setup the bode user test, the fields labeled “req” (required) must be set.While the test is running, the resulting phase and gain is displayed.
The user may also add other variables in the empty boxes. To use this feature, the user must be fully acquainted with frequency response techniques and the flight control software.3.4.3 Scope This menu item brings up a separate window referred to as the Scope utility.It can be used to collect one or more variables for a user-specified time sampled at rates up to the critical frequency of the flight control process.The collected data can be viewed using a CAE graphical tool such as Autograph or XGR.A trigger control panel provides control over trigger source (a variable), trigger level, pre-trigger, and trigger mode (above, equal or below a specified value, etc).Variables can be located in the CDB or in any control process’ global section running on the DBU or on the PCMIP-DSP (or other, depending on the platform on which the flight control process is running).It can also store user-defined setups and the output filename for captured data can be specified.
Figure 24 - The Scope utility The following variables can be entered in the user-entry boxes of the Variables area: • A variable from the CDB associated with the DSP process. Variables from other CDB will be accepted but always yield a zero result during the collection.• A global process variable which is any variable in the process that is not defined within a C function.• A DBU (cPDSP3u) global variable (If DBUs are present, the environment variable for the exe_dbu should have been automatically set to point to the correct cPDSP3u debug out file).The variable types supported by the utility are signed and unsigned chars, signed and unsigned shorts, signed and unsigned integers, floats, and doubles.They can be part of a structure, an array, or a structure array.The components of the utility are described in the following sub-sections.User Guide jDFC Page 34 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.
3.4.3.1 Control Panel The Scope utility is “started” and “stopped” using the toggle button in this panel. When the utility is not collecting, the button displays “Start” and the Status d i s p l a y s “ O f f ” .I f n o v a r i a b l e s a r e defined in the Variables area or one or more variables have not been found, the “Start” button is shaded and does not respond to user selection.When the “Start” button is not shaded, the user can select it.If no trigger condition is defined, the button display changes to “Stop” until data collection is complete.If a trigger condition is defined, the Status changes to either “Standby” or “Armed”.If the trigger condition is already met at the time the button is pressed, the Status changes to “Standby” and remains so until the trigger condition is no longer true, at which point “Armed ” is displayed: this prevents false starts.
This is only applicable to floats and doubles whereas all other types go into “Armed” immediately upon starting the utility. When the trigger condition is met or when in manual mode, the Status changes to “Sampling” until the full sampling interval has elapsed.The control panel also displays the time since the utility has ‘started’ while it is searching for the trigger, or the time since the collection has begun if the trigger condition was realized or in manual mode.3.4.3.2 Save Setups The environment setup defined by the user in the scope utility can be saved to a file so that it can be recalled at a later time.The components of this panel are: • Saved Setups: This pull-down list displays all previously saved setups.Any one of these can be recalled by moving down the list and selecting with a left click of the mouse.• Remove: Clicking this button will remove the currently selected setup from the saved setup list, if it was selected.
If two or more saved setups by the same name exist in the saved setup list, the first one in the list will be cleared. • Clear setup: Clicking this button will clear all entries in the utility.• Create: The user can save the scope utility setup into the saved setup using this button.Saving a setup with the same name as another one in the list will duplicate it.All newly created setups are placed at the bottom of the saved setup list, not alphabetically.• Update current setup: When a user is working on a selected saved setup, he/she can save the changes to the same setup, effectively updating the saved setup.3.4.3.3 Setup window The setup window allows the user to control the behavior of Scope.These include the source of the variable data (DSP/process index), trigger parameters, sampling frequency and time, and the file name of the result data.• Scope on DSP Process number: This parameter defines the source (DSP/process index) of the collected variables.
The scope utility can collect variables from only one process at a time (e.g. control_dsp0.out, control_dsp1.out, etc.) • Trigger label: This parameter defines the name of the variable used for triggering.All previously listed variable types can be used for triggering.However, only floats and doubles will have hysteresis-triggering to prevent false starts.This is mentioned in the control panel section above where the trigger condition, if already met at the start, must become false before the trigger is enabled.• Trigger level: This parameter defines the value of the trigger variable at which the trigger will occur.User Guide jDFC Page 35 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.
• Trigger mode: This parameter defines the condition when triggering will occur: above or below trigger level, equal or not equal to the level, outside or inside +/-level, and finally if the trigger variable undergoes any change [(rigger level is not used in this condition). This parameter is set to MANUAL when the trigger function is not used.• Pre-trigger: The pre-trigger parameter (in seconds) enables the user to collect and later view the time history of variables before the trigger event.Negative pre-trigger inputs will be forced to zero.This value can not exceed 95% of the sampling time.• Sampling time: The total collection time in seconds (including pre-trigger time) is set here.The minimum setting depends on the critical rate of the process and the collection element length, and will be set by the utility if the user sets a value that is too low.
• Sampling Frequency: The sampling frequency (in Hertz) is based on the selected sampling time and cannot be modified directly by the user. • Result filename: The collection results are compressed into a CAE proprietary format into a file of extension agb, which can be viewed using either Autograph or XGR.If a setup is used, the output filename will be the same name as the setup; otherwise, the filename will be scope.agb.The user can override the output filename by typing a name in the filename box and can also lock it so that any setup name changes will not modify it.3.4.3.4 Variables window Clicking on a white empty box allows the user to type in a variable.The type and source of the variable follows the rules outlined in the section above.Scope cannot be started if a variable is not resolved [found in the possible process sources global and CDB sections].
3.4.4 Quick List of labels Figure 25 - Quick List popup window This menu item’s function is similar to the Generic Monitor Popup (see section 3.4.1 ) except that the separate window pops up with a list of variables already entered. This list can be modified and saved by the user.User Guide jDFC Page 36 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.3.5 Configuration Menu This menu regroups all the options and functionalities related to the configuration of the utility.Figure 26 - Configuration menu 3.5.1 Read-Only Mode This option is used when the user only wants to monitor system variables.This mode is also activated by default when the user invokes the utility while another instance of MCLServer is already running.In this situation, the user is given three choices: 1) to continue in read-only mode, 2) to terminate the other MCLServer instance, or 3) to abort.
3.5.2 IOS-style numerical input This option can be selected when the utility is running on a computer equipped with a touch-screen interface - typically the Instructor Operating Station (IOS). It allows the user to input numbers to the read/write monitors via a touch-screen keypad instead of a keyboard.The size of most user interface components (such as buttons, menus, etc.) also increases.This setting is enabled by default when the name of the computer running the utility contains ‘IOS’.Since a right-click is not possible with a touch-screen interface, a double-click on a Monitor will be interpreted as a right-click when this mode is active.3.5.3 Configuration file Figure 27 - Configuration file dialog User Guide jDFC Page 37 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.This menu item brings up a separate window with the utility’s configuration file.
This file is used to configure various aspects of the utility. There are currently three supported flags: • MCLServer-debug: This flag is used when troubleshooting the server program.When set to true, this flag will pause the utility just before the first request is sent, allowing the user to attach a debugger to the server program before any interaction happens.• Echo-traffic: This flag is used when troubleshooting the communication between the server program and the utility.This is equivalent to setting the “Echo GUI-Server traffic in Console” option (see section 3.6.3 for details), but at a much earlier time (when the user can finally activate the option from the menu, a lot of communication has already happened).• Alternate-server: This flag is also used when troubleshooting the server program.This option allows specifying an alternate server program to be launched, as opposed to the regular MCLServer.exe program.
3.5.4 Server Environment This menu item brings up a separate window containing a list of all the relevant environment variables as seen by the MCLServer program and the Flight Controls software. Figure 28 - Server Environment dialog box 3.5.5 Print test results This checkbox is used to turn on or off automatic printing of test results.User Guide jDFC Page 38 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.3.6 Help This menu regroups all the Help features.Figure 29 - Help menu 3.6.1 Report an Issue This menu item is linked to a web page that is used to report problems with the utility.Selecting this item invokes the default web browser.As this web page is located inside CAE, this option will not be functional once the simulator is installed at the customer’s facilities.3.6.2 Show Log file This menu item brings up a separate window containing the log file of the utility.
This is useful when debugging problems related to the utility itself. 3.6.3 Debug This sub-menu regroups debugging features of the utility.These are: • Echo GUI-Server traffic in Console • WebFork Debug Flag The first menu item transcripts everything that is exchanged between the utility and the MCLServer process and can be used for trouble-shooting when required.The second menu item is a debug flag for the OSU component called “WebFork” which does the actual network connection between the computer running jDFC and the computer running the Controls software.3.6.4 About This menu item brings up a small dialog box containing more information about the authors and the revision numbers of the utility and the MCLServer.It also contains the revision history of both utilities.User Guide jDFC Page 39 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.
Pages Displayed pages in jDFC can be made visible (one at a time) by clicking on the proper tab. 4.1 Calibration & Tuning In simulator flight control systems, force and position transducers are located at the control loading actuator but the forces to be simulated are measured at the pilot's input.A mechanical linkage whose gearing varies with control movement connects the pilot control and actuator.The CAL utility is used to specify the non-linear gearing functions relating forces and positions at the pilot input to those at the actuator.Having quantified the relationship between pilot and actuator variables, one can deal in forces and positions as measured at the pilot, leaving the work of conversion to and from actuator scaling to the calibration and control software.
Figure 30 - Calibration & Tuning page The Calibration & Tuning page is divided into the following panels: • Calibration breakpoints • Servo controller • Monitoring • Calibration • Back-drive User Guide jDFC Page 40 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document. These are described in the following sections.4.1.1 Calibration Breakpoints This panel displays actuator position breakpoints and allows the user to modify them.Breakpoints can be added or deleted by right-clicking on the desired actuator position breakpoint and selecting either INSERT or DELETE.For each actuator position breakpoint, the associated pilot position, gearing (ratio of forces) between pilot and actuator, mechanical friction, and force offset can be entered manually, although the last two (friction and force offset) are generally done via automatic means.4.1.1.1 Actuator Position A minimum of two actuator position breakpoints must be defined.
The values of the first and last actuator position breakpoints (which cannot be deleted) are fixed at positive and negative full- scale (+/-2 inches). Each actuator position breakpoint has an associated pilot position, force gearing, force offset and mechanical friction.The calibration table is sorted based on ascending actuator position column values.Modifying the actuator position breakpoints may cause the calibration table to re-sort.4.1.1.2 Pilot Position This column defines an equivalent pilot position value at each actuator position breakpoint.The slope of the pilot vs.actuator position function is used in some scaling computations; therefore it is important to avoid unrealistic slopes and reversals, even outside of the practical range of actuator travel [end point extrapolation].End points: The pilot positions at the fixed actuator breakpoints (+/-2 inches) are automatically extrapolated such that the end slopes match those of the adjacent measured segment.
4.1.1.3 Force Gearing This column defines a force gearing value at each actuator position breakpoint. The force gearing determines the instantaneous calibrated ratio of actuator force to pilot force at each breakpoint.End points: The force gearings at the fixed actuator breakpoints (+/-2 inches) are automatically extrapolated such that the end slopes match those of the adjacent measured segment.4.1.1.4 Friction This column defines a mechanical friction value at each actuator position breakpoint.End points: The frictions at the fixed actuator breakpoints (+/-2 inches) are automatically made equal to the adjacent points.4.1.1.5 Force Offset This column defines a force transducer offset value at each actuator position breakpoint.End points: The force transducer offset values at the fixed actuator breakpoints (+/- 2 inches) are automatically extrapolated such that the end slopes match those of the adjacent measured segment.
4.1.2 Servo Controller This panel displays servo controller parameters such as gains and filter components and allows the user to modify non-volatile parameters. User Guide jDFC Page 41 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.1.3 Monitoring This panel displays a set of monitored variables.4.1.4 Calibration This panel provides access to non-volatile calibration mode parameters that are used to calibrate and tune a control actuator.4.1.5 Backdrive The window provides access to the non-volatile back-drive parameters, allowing the user to adjust the behaviour of the back-drive controller.4.1.6 Force Compensation The load cell of the control picks up the acceleration forces of the flight control mass in the simulator, thereby adversely slowing the model and impacting the dynamical characteristics.The force compensation panel provides access to algorithms which can compensate for this.
The parameters of these are gains, filter frequencies and damping. It is not recommended to adjust these manually, rather the ‘tests’ pull down menu provides an automatic means of computing these.Once computed, the compensation can be switched on or off with the enable pull down menu in the panel.User Guide jDFC Page 42 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.2 Safeties The flight controls software includes safety code that continuously monitors the value of certain parameters such as force and velocity against safety limits defined on the safety page.These limits can be manually adjusted by the user from zero up to the computed max limits displayed in the right-hand column.The maximum limits set by the controller are dependent on the actuator type of the selected channel.
These limits are used to detect unsafe operating conditions and cause controls to turn off, thus preventing possible injury to the pilot and damage to the actuator components. The “ Value ” column displays the current value of the associated parameter.The “Max Value ” column displays the highest values detected since controls were activated.These parameters should be used to set the failure detection thresholds in the “ Limit ” column.Only fully- qualified users should effect changes to the “ Limit ” column values as changing them could compromise the safety and performance of the control.Note the “Max Value” can be set higher than the “Limit” when the “status” is set to “delay” or “NO LIM”; these overriding status cannot be set by the user through the GUI; they are set in the software in specific conditions for instance, throttles which have high forces when activating the reversers in an rejected takeoff condition.

Figure 32 - FeelSpring page The user can insert or delete position breakpoints by right-clicking on the appropriate row on the position column and selecting insert or delete. The position, force and friction breakpoints can be changed simply by clicking on the desired cell.Feelspring curves are continuously sorted in ascending order of the position breakpoint column.The user can also insert or delete entire force curves by right clicking on the curve tab on the right of the tables.The curve value can be changed by clicking on the curve tab value.Text can also be added to the curve value by right- clicking and selecting text.Other feelspring characteristics are displayed; some are adjustable by the user.These include: • FEELAFT Select whether the feelspring simulation is existing at the forward or aft quadrant of the model [latter requiring cable stretch compensation].This is set during the design of the model and should not be tampered with.
• FEELKN Feelspring notch stiffness (Force/position gain) User Guide jDFC Page 44 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document. • FEELNPL/FEELNNL Positive and negative feelspring notches which are added to feelspring output force at all positions depending on positive or negative position break point.• NPL/NNL Positive and negative feelspring notches which only modify the feelspring force within the notch width ([stiffness) thereby not affecting forces at breakpoints other than zero.

Only personnel knowledgeable in the control model should adjust them. Figure 33 - Model page User Guide jDFC Page 46 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.5 Tables The table page allows the user to create and define interpolated look-up tables with 1 or 2 input and to save them to the data file.A table can be inserted or removed by right-clicking on the frame of a table.Rows and columns can be inserted or removed by right-clicking on the row or column header elements.The input and output variable names are typed directly into the appropriate cells.Any global or CDB variable contained in any flight control process can be typed in.The target process is selectable via a pull-down list.The rate at which a table output is computed is selectable via a pull-down list, and corresponds to the control process iterative bands.
The table rows are automatically sorted in ascending order according to the header column values. If a variable selected as output is over-written by another function [such as in the control process], a message to that effect will appear in the System information window.Tables are usually created and populated during the design phase of a project and should not be tampered with, as they are most often model related.Figure 34 - Tables page User Guide jDFC Page 47 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.6 FCM The FCM table provides the user control over the flight control measurement service.When an externally-mounted force and position measurement system is connected to the control process, the position and force input are displayed on the FCM page.These allow the user, via the FCM tests, to calibrate the control actuator position and force in an automated fashion.
On sophisticated measurement devices such as the CAE 6-axis digital force sensor, geometric gains can be set for each axis to compensate for the control geometry, yielding repeatable operator and technique-insensitive measurements. All these parameters are saved to the data file.FCM can also make use of other external measuring equipment like the Fokker and DFCMS boxes.The measurement equipment must be interfaced into the AID device, connected to a DBU chassis.Further, the type of equipment [JR3, DFCMS, Fokker] need be indicated to the system via special cables or connectors containing an I button with a programmed name corresponding to the equipment.Figure 35 - FCM page The FCM utility provides both the ability to calibrate a control [force, position, compliance] and to produce force curves for certifying conformity to aircraft manufacturer flight test data for the certification authorities.
The force, position and compliance are automatically determined via auto-cal tests available from the ‘tests’ pull-down menu. The user need only follow the popup menus describing the procedure to follow.With the test running, the user can see which breakpoint is under calibration as it is displayed in FCM on the status breakpoint column.The various panels on this page are described in the following sections.User Guide jDFC Page 48 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.
4.6.1 Monitoring The following variables appear in this panel: FPOS Forward mass position including cable stretch POSI FCM input position (after sensor calibration) POSO FCM output position (posi * posgn) - allows user to invert output or apply scaling FRCI FCM input force (after sensor calibration and compensation) FRCO FCM output force frci * frcgn, allows user to invert position or apply scaling FP Actual force in pilot units FPU Actual force in actuator units POSREF POSO offset POSGN Scaling applied to POSI FRCGN Scaling applied to FRCI FXGEO X-axis geometric compensation applied to JR3 linear forces FYGEO Y-axis geometric compensation applied to JR3 linear forces FZGEO Z-axis geometric compensation applied to JR3 linear forces MXGEO X-axis geometric compensation applied to JR3 moments MYGEO Y-axis geometric compensation applied to JR3 moments MZGEO Z-axis geometric compensation applied to JR3 moments JR3SERN JR3 serial number JR3STA JR3 status - indicates sensor problems POSSTA Position transducer status - indicates sensor problems POSTYPE Position sensor type (string, accelerometer, etc.) 4.6.2 Calibration This panel provides access to non-volatile calibration mode parameters that are used to calibrate and tune a control actuator.
4.6.3 Backdrive The window provides access to the non-volatile back-drive parameters and allows the user to adjust the behaviour of the back-drive controller. 4.6.4 Control Panel The control panel provides user control of the input and selected channel.The force and position input can be reset to zero via the reset button.The user can also select the input source for FCM autocal tests via the ‘Input select’; it can be FCM sensors or control inputs such as XP position in pilot units.This is only used when a particular sensor is not available.4.6.4.1 Accel Calib button The FCM position accelerometer sensor, which requires calibration before it can provide useful data, is calibrated via this button.The user must first place the accelerometer vertically on one of its sides and click the ‘ACCEL CALIB’ button to tell FCM to note the input state.The sensed side is indicated by the POS STAT variable in the monitoring window.Repeating this process for all 4 sides fully calibrates the sensor.
4.6.4.2 Reset button This button is used to zero the position sensor. 4.6.4.3 Channel This variable defines the currently-selected actuator channel.User Guide jDFC Page 49 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.6.4.4 Autocal Mode The selected autocal test is displayed here, eg: position, force, compliance or back-drive.These are described in a later section.4.6.4.5 Autocal Status The autocal test status is displayed here.These are: • OFF • Standby: sampling data during an autocal run • Ready: computations have converged and results can be accepted by the user • Accept: user input, this is not visible as it is the user to set when the status is ready • Failed: a fault condition has occurred [see other panel status] • Abort: user input, this is not visible as the user sets this, forcing the status to OFF 4.6.4.6 Autocal Fault Fault conditions generated by autocal tests are displayed here.
These are: • FCMNORMAL: no fault present • FCMSTANDBY: sampling data during an autocal run • DUP_ELEM: sensor calibration panel has duplicated ‘in’ breakpoint • LIMIT_EXC: autocal computed force gearing exceeds expected limits • FCMTIMEOUT: RS485 communication with JR3 sensor has timed out • SLOPE_REV: sensor calibration panel slope reversal [‘out’ breakpoints are not uniquely ascending or descending] • FRC_INV: autocal compliance test has detected a force input inversion • EXC_XPU: autocal position test has detected an actuator xpu beyond limits [+/-2 inches] • CRC_FAIL: JR3 sensor RS485 data has bad circular checksum • DRIVEOUT: autocal back-drive test position request has timed out [actuator not following] 4.6.4.7 Input Select Position/force input source selection; the user can chose whether the position to be used for autocal tests and for producing QTG graphs is from the externally mounted sensor [FCM] or from the actuator calibration [XP].
The latter should only be used if a control is already fully calibrated [and is meaningless for position autocal!] and does not include compliance so may not be correct for QTGs. It is best to always use an externally mounted position sensor.4.6.5 Calibration Breakpoints This array is a duplicate of the actuator breakpoint array on the Calibration & Tuning page except that the force and friction are replaced with RESULT and STATUS columns.When an automated or user-assisted calibration test is underway or has completed, the computed parameters (force gearing, pilot position, etc) for a particular break point are displayed in the RESULT column.If a value has not sufficiently converged, it will be displayed as zero.The status column displays the status of the breakpoint convergence, and can be standby (result not sufficiently converged), active (breakpoint currently under computation), or completed (result sufficiently converged and being further refined).
4.6.6 Sensor Calibration This section is used uniquely to calibrate string position sensors. These two columns allow the user to select the desired output POS OUT for a given sensor POS IN’ .Since string sensors cannot provide accurate angular position, this table allows the linear sensor to be calibrated for accurate angular position output.User Guide jDFC Page 50 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.6.7 Compliance The control force path between the actuator sensor and the pilot position at which the calibration equipment is mounted is always compliant.The compliance terms are set here to compensate the forward position FPOS so that it corresponds to the true pilot position under load.ZMLAG Filter lag on compliance term: 1 or less.Reduces ZM-induced noise.ZMPOS Positive compliance term.ZMNEG Negative compliance term.
FCMZMPOS/NEG : FCM computed compliance terms [via autocal] 4.6.8 Sensor setup To use the FCM sensors, a special FCM cable must be attached to the cockpit AID 50 pin D type connector. This cable allows connection of position and force sensors and allows FCM to recognize their presence via a programmed I-button in the FCM cable.The position sensors available for FCM are shown below.The inclinometer provides position over +/-45 degrees and only requires a scaling adjustment before use.The accelerometer has 3 axes and requires a four-point user interaction calibration procedure.Finally, the string sensor is fully digital with approximately 1000 pulses per inch and is often used for pedals.It is the only device that makes use of the position calibration table in FCM, which the user can populate with values such that the linear output is angular or other.The six-axis JR3 force transducer requires no calibration.
It is fully digital and has internal factory calibration that FCM deciphers and utilizes. JR3/Inclinometer/accelerometer/string sensors Inclinometer calibration: Connect the inclinometer to the FCM cable.Set it on a level surface, press reset on the FCM page so that POSI is zero.Slant the inclinometer on a known angle less than 45 degree.Adjust POSGN so that POSO equates to that angle.Accelerometer calibration: On a flat level surface, place one of the sides of the accelerometer on this surface and press “Accel Calib” in FCM.POSSTA will display the axis this side corresponds too.Repeat for the other three sides.When the last side is done, POSSTA displays “Calibrated.Verify the calibration on the same surface; POSI label should be 90deg +/-0.3 deg.You can press the reset to set any angle to be zero.String calibration: POSI will equate to inches of string displacement.It is used as input variable to the PosIn table column.
The inch values in this column equate to the PosOut column values that are of whatever units you desire. Lastly, POSGN is applied to the resulting output and is displayed in POSO.When the string is at the desired zero position, press the reset.Follow by populating the PosOut User Guide jDFC Page 51 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.column with the desired values.Move the control to these positions and with the string connected to the control, set the PosIn associated breakpoint to the POSI value.4.6.9 Autocal tests Autocal Position test: Mount the position sensor on the control.Calibrate the sensor if required.Select autocal position from the drop-down test menu.FCM will automatically seek an end stop and slowly backdrive the control over its entire travel range.Do not interfere with it.It will register the position sensor values and use them to compute the “actuator position” column values.
The converged results will appear in the “result” table. When completed, FCM will ask whether these values are to be copied to the calibration table.FCM can copy all “completed” results or the user can copy them manually.The values that have not converged will not be copied.Autocal Force test: Mount the force and position sensor on the control.Calibrate the position sensor if required.Select autocal force from the drop-down menu.FCM will engage the calmod notch and begin monitoring the sensors while you slowly and smoothly cycle the control over its entire range.The calibration break point that is currently coincident with the position of the control will be shown in the ‘calibration breakpoint’ panel ‘status’ column as ACTIVE and its accumulated result will be displayed in the ‘result’ column.If the data for that breakpoint has converged, the status will change to COMPLETED.
Even after a breakpoint has completed and the control is at that breakpoint, the breakpoint will continue to improve its result. When sufficiently enough of the breakpoints have completed, the user can have FCM automatically copy the results to the ‘calibration breakpoint’ panel ‘gearing’ column (only those that are completed) or manually do so.Autocal Backdrive test: This test is not a true auto-calibration procedure for the control calibration, but is used rather to calibrate the PosIn column (string sensor panel) to match an already calibrated control.Install the string sensor on the control, set the control at the zero position, and press reset.Select ‘Autocal Backdrive’from the drop-down ’tests’ menu.FCM will cycle the control to the PosOut column values and automatically set the PosIn column to the POSI values.Autocal Compliance test: Mount the force and position sensor on the control.Calibrate the position sensor if required.Select autocal compliance from the drop down menu.
Slowly and smoothly apply a large force on the control in either direction. The compliance terms FCMZMPOS and FCMZMNEG will update with the converging results.FCM can copy the results into the ZMPOS and ZMNEG variables upon a user ‘accept’ request.Note that the position sensor should be mounted as close to the point of application of force so that most if not all of the compliance path [pilot position to actuator force cell] is measured.4.6.10 Trouble shooting : The following is a list of possible problems with FCM and their probable source/solution.POSSTA/FCMSTA: the position and fcm status panel flags DUP_ELEM position sensor table has duplicated entries LIM_EXC Computed force gearing beyond 0.01 and 10.0 range TIMEOUT back drive command tracking timeout SLP_REV position sensor table slope inversion User Guide jDFC Page 52 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.
FRC_INV compliance force inverted detected EXC_XPU XPU exceeded 1.995 in position calibration CRC_FAIL JR3 digital sensor RS422 checksum data failure POSO or FRCO are zero: • POSGN or FRCG N are zero! Autocal Force: • Neutral break point never Completes:  Increase CALKN (notch slope) • Gearing transient across neutral:  Do autotune fric/force + FCM force bias (reset) • Cannot Complete stops:  Adjust actuator or pilot position breakpoints • Gearing wrong:  For linear force on the wheel, MZGAIN should be the inverse radius, however, to calibrate in moment of in*lbs, MZGAIN should be 1.Check geometric gains [pay attention to sign].Autocal Compliance: • Inputs inverted fault:  Use FRCGN or POSGN to invert the force or position Autocal position: • Position result is inverted:  Use POSGN to invert the position • Exceeds 1.995 in XPU:  Actuator needs adjustment or set POS to zero • Repeated results inconsistent:  Move control slow and smooth.
• Inclinometer registers wrongly:  +5 V missing on connector.  Improper gains or calibration • Force vs position plots have the wrong position excursion: User Guide jDFC Page 53 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document. The sensor should be installed closest to the pilot force application point to incorporate all compliant control paths.For inclinometers, this may lead to susceptibility to acceleration forces during the control sweep.Applying care in smooth motion should reduce the effect.Column tubes may comply in a curved manner, leading to incorrect local angular measurements.Use the string sensor instead.• FCMMOD goes to off unexpectedly:  Fcmmod will shut off due to failures or faults (see FCMFLT and FCMREM) or when C/L is in standby (CALMOD) or OFF • Rudder pedal calibration  The rudder pedals present a special challenge to the FCM user as both pedals must be calibrated in turn.
You must calibrate each independently and use CALOFF to offset the CALMOD notch position. The latter corrects the problem of computing the gearing at the zero pilot/actuator breakpoint since the notch is displaced away from the region of interest.For instance, when calibrating the positive region of pilot position, set CALOFF to move the pedal toward the rear of the cockpit (say 25% of half travel) which will move the pedal away from the measuring area.Once both pedals have been calibrated, it is hoped the two zero gearings match: if not, take the average.The user must judiciously select the correct one-sided set of results (do not ACCEPT) and copy them manually.This applies to autocal ZM compliance, position and force.4.6.11 TIPS Inclinometer setup: Gravimetric inclinometers perform best when their rotation axis is horizontal.They are prone to acceleration noise and respond slowly (0.5 to 2 Hz).
When calibrating the wheel, the column should be back-driven such that the inclinometer is as vertical as possible. The inclinometers can be fixed to the control or the control bracket with two-sided tape.The closer to the control pivot point, the better, as linear acceleration adversely affects these sensors.For the column, placing the inclinometer closest to the floor is best.On the wheel, closest to the center of the wheel motion is best.However, this is only suitable for position and force calibration.Any validation tests such as static force curves should have the inclinometer installed closest to the pilot handhold to include the control part compliance.This is also true of the compliance calibration test.Digital string setup: If an electric inclinometer is not available, a digital string sensor can be substituted.It requires more careful setup on the user’s part.
If a control wheel is being calibrated, the string should be wrapped around the JR3 load cell puck, making certain the string is in the same rotation plane as the puck. Calculate or otherwise extract from the equipment calibration sheets the break points or position gain (POSGN to convert degrees, inches, etc ) you need enter in FCM.Use of a hand- held inclinometer can provide calibration of the string by measuring the signal from the string (as read by POSI) to specific inclinometer deflections, say +/- 45 degrees.Don't forget to select a reference (POSREF) and to zero it.Compliance/Fokker plots: • It is best to install the position sensor on the control nearest the point of force application but preferably not on the Fokker bracket as its compliance would be added to the measured User Guide jDFC Page 54 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.control compliance.
Sensors installed at these positions are more susceptible to vibration on the part of the operator, so care in providing a smooth motion is suggested. • Compliance curves are seldom linear and this can cause varying results depending on the force applied and the length of time spent at a particular force level.A smooth and constant force rate of change is best, perhaps attaining 30% of the load unit's maximum capacity, with no hesitation at a particular force level.It is suggested that you plot the force versus position at the same time as you are doing the compliance test in order to check whether the compliance is straight or curved.If it is curved, autocal may very well compute an average that will vary upon the extent of your force range and not appropriate for your control type.In this case, derive from your plot the ZM.
• When using the accelerometer, be aware that it registers the LOCAL angular deflection (where the sensor is mounted), and thus may be providing an artificially more compliant measurement (the column tube is very susceptible to curving under load). This can be checked by installing the inclinometer at the mid point and the near the pivot point of the control, and comparing the computed ZMs.Probably a middle ground is best.It is better to use the STRING sensor as it will register the true angular compliance of the control from the point of measurement to the pivot point of the control.Force Gearing: It can't be said enough: zero both the hands-free sensor force and flight control force transducer (autotune).Any offsets between these will degrade the division performed on accumulated forces within FCM, producing a transient across the neutral position gearing.
Fokker & DFCMS test boxes: To use these other measuring equipment, acquire the ‘banana to 50 pin D type interface connector which has an included I button programmed to tell FCM of these devices. POSGN and FRCGN will provide the necessary calibration adjustment to render correct sign and scale on the QTG tests for these sensor interfaces.Geometric gains: The FCM equipment can be used to accurately measure control forces on any simulator even if there is no pre-programmed configuration for that aircraft type.The geometric linear force and moment compensation gains are saved to the data file, and when set once, require no further attention by the user.The derivation of the geometry compensation gains for the column is as follows: User Guide jDFC Page 55 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.
The sum of the moments about the column rotation point is: X Y Z TOT M a F L F M+ × − × = The effective force that is applied to the column is Mtot/L: LM La FFLMFX Y ZTOT+×− = = The desired gains for column measurements are: Xgain = 0.0 Ygain = a/L Zgain = 1.0 Xmgain = 1/L Ymgain = 0.0 Zmgain = 0.0 (All dimensions in inches) The derivation for the wheel is much simpler as it involves only a pure moment about the Z axis. Thus Xgain = 0.0 Ygain = 0.0 Zgain = 0.0 Xmgain = 0.0 Ymgain = 0.0 Zmgain = 1/b The pedals present special problems because the geometry of the pedal changes through its stroke.Because of this, it is not possible to provide linear geometric compensation as for the column.Thus the derivation for the pedal is simple as only the Z force is used: User Guide jDFC Page 56 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.

4.8 Timing This page displays performance parameters for the synchronous tasks running within all flight control processes. Each task’s rate, period, execution time, maximum execution time, and overrun count is shown.Pressing the Reset button resets latched values for “ Max Time ” and “Overruns ” for all tasks.Figure 37 - Timing page User Guide jDFC Page 59 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.9 DBU This page displays information about the flight control cPDSP3u(s) as well as the cPAD3u(s) that are connected to them via the DBU back-plane.It also lists the devices (actuators, measurement equipment, etc) that are connected to the cPAD3u(s).The status of the safety loop detection points is also displayed.The status of the safety loop detection points can be latched at control turn-on by selecting the “Latch Safety Loop at Startup” button.
This can be of assistance in trouble-shooting problems at start-up. A 0 indicates the safety loop is open at that point, whereas a 1 indicates it is closed.The identification button (I-button) content of a particular device can be accessed by clicking on the desired channel – the information appears in the I- button Info panel.Figure 38 - DBU page User Guide jDFC Page 60 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.4.10 IEEE-1394 This page provides the user with information concerning the performance of the IEEE-1394 communication link.It consists of two panels: “Communication Info” and “1394 Errors”.The displayed information is available for the individual DSP channels and IEEE-1394 adapters as defined by the channel and “Adapter” pull-down menus respectively.Clicking the “Reset” button resets all the error counters for the selected IEEE-1394 adapter.
This page should be consulted if the user suspects a problem with the IEEE-1394 communication. Figure 39 - IEEE-1394 page 4.10.1 Communication Info This panel displays all the defined IEEE-1394 channel tags along with associated parameters such as isochronous channel number, toggle word difference, I/O buffer sizes, and transmission sub-band period.Using this information, the user can determine if the defined IEEE-1394 channels tags are being transferred and received.Tag Numerical value of the channel tag in hexadecimal format.Name Name of the channel tag in ASCII format.Isoch Specifies the IEEE-1394 isochronous channel number (0 to 63) used for transmission.User Guide jDFC Page 61 10021970 Revision 0 Use or disclosure of this document is subject to the restriction on the title page of this document.Toggle Specifies the number of elapsed iterations from transmission to reception of a channel tag.This value will continuously increment if the channel tag information is not received.
I-Buf Size Specifies the channel tag input (receive) data buffer size in bytes. This value must match the channel tag “O-Buf Size” of the transmit node.An error is generated if the receive data size does not match the specified value.O-Buf Size Specifies the channel tag output (transmit) data buffer size in bytes.This value must match the channel tag “I-Buf Size” of the receive node.Subbnd Specifies the channel tag transmit sub-banding period.• A value of zero implies a sequential channel tag transfer.These tags are transmitted sequentially one per iteration.For example, if there are three sequential channel tags defined, each individual tag will be transmitted every third iteration.• A value of one indicates that the channel tag will be transmitted each iteration.• A value greater than 1 specifies the sub-band period.For example, a value of two implies transmission every second iteration.Note: The DSP band that initiates the transmission defines the iteration rate.
4.10.2 1394 Errors This section lists all the IEEE-1394 error counters. For synchronized interconnected nodes, the counters should all be zero.For non-synchronized nodes, the “Missed 1394 packet” and “Descriptor overrun” counters may increment.A description of the individual error counters is provided below.• Undefined isochronous channel number The requested isochronous channel number has not been defined.• Transmission buffer overflow The transmission buffer size is insufficient to handle all the requested data.• Error getting the asynchronous packet status An error was encountered when requesting the status of the received asynchronous packet.• Packet not sent error The IEEE-1394 driver did not transmit the previously requested asynchronous packet.• Error sending asynchronous packet An error was encounter when requesting an asynchronous packet transmission.

The Motion Control Cabinet provides motor control for the actuators along with safety limits and features required to operate the motion system during normal and failure modes. The EM motion system operates much like a traditional hydraulic motion base with the majority of hydraulic functions related to operation and safety being replaced by equiv alent EM systems.3 System Description CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 8 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.3.1 System overview The electric motion system creates the desired motion by converting electrical energy into linear actuator movement.This is performed using a closed loop control system consisting of three major components.Moog Sim ulation Software - Provides a position, velocity and acceleration limited position command for the motion system .Resides in the MCC.
Motion Control Cabinet – Uses the actuator position command and EM actuator feedback position to generate a velocity, ac celeration and current limited PWM torque command to the EM Actuator . EM Actuator – Converts the PWM torque command into linear actuator movement.Provides position feedback to the Motion Control Cabinet .Motion System Cabinet Customer Server Server SoftwareMoog Simulation SoftwareActuator Length CommandsActuator Length CommandsCSA Servo Drive (x6)Electro- Mechanical Actuator (x6)PWM Torque Command Encoder Position Feedback Facility floorPayloadMotion Figure 3-1 System Overview 3 System Description CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 9 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.3.1.1 EM Actuator The EMA consists of a brushless DC servo motor directly integrated (no coupling) to a precision ground ball screw assembly that converts rotary motion into linear motion.
The translation from rotary to linear motion is achieved by the following sequence of events: Current applied to stator Stator magnetic field causes the rotor / screw assembly to rotate Nut / extension tube assembly travels along the screw Extension tube e xtends and retracts converting rotary into linear motion The actuator has a 4 -bolt interface at the base end and a single bolt interface at the rod end. The bolted interfaces allow for a standard actuator design that can be adapted to custom clevis and joint designs.EncoderEncoder ConnectorStator & RotorHome SwitchBall Nut & ScrewExtension Tube Motor Oil Drain PlugMotor Oil Fill Port Figure 3-2 Actuator Motor Assembly 3 System Description CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 10 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.The motor is specifically optimized for the flight simulator market and is designed for low speed smoothness, high power dens ity, and low inertia.
Other key advantages of the integrated actuator include: Dynamic response High reliability/life Low audible noise Low transmitted vibrations Reduced length Actuator end of stroke is protected with a patented dual acting hydraulic cushion assembly. The assembly is engaged 3 inches from the end of stroke, extend or retract, and is designed to safely dissipate kinetic energy of the payload and actuator components.The hydraulic cushion is sized to safely limit acceleration to motion system occupants during worst -case failure modes at the maximum velocity and inertia load case.Hydraulic Cushion PistonExtension Tube Figure 3-3 Hydraulic Cushion Assembly NOTE: EMA dimensions are provided in the EMA installation Drawing (*Varies per system – provided on Tech nical Documentation CD).3 System Description CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 11 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.

3.1.3 Moog Motion Control Computer and Simulation Software The Moog Simulation Software resides on the Moog Motion Control Computer ( MCC ). The Moog Simulation Software provides actuator position commands to the Motion Control Cabinet via an Ethercat interface to the CSA servo drives.The commands originate either from the host interface or internally from one of several command generators.The Moog Simulation Software applies appropriate position, velocity and acceleration limits to the commands.Additionally the Moog motion control computer communicates with the Motion Control Cabinet via an Ethernet interface to the PLC.The Moog Simulation Software uses this interface to command PLC controlled functions in the Motion Control Cabinet and to r eceive status information from the Motion Control Cabinet .The Moog Simulation Software uses status information from the servo drives and PLC along with its own status to present fault and other system information to the user/operator.
It provides the gra phical user interface for users/operators to commission, troubleshoot, maintain and operate the motion system. Details of the Moog Simulation Software GUI are provided in section 7.2 this manual.3 System Description CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 18 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.3.1.4 Motion System Performance For information regarding: Payload Mass Properties Excursion Capability Velocity Capability and Performance Acceleration Capability and Performance Refer to specific Motion Mechanics Installation Drawing (refer to Table 1 -3).3 System Description CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 19 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.3.2 Motion System Features RTH – The RTH amplifiers are used to retract the motion system actuators in the event of a CSA servo drive failure or other class 2 fault that results in the disconnection of the CSA servo drives from control of the actuators.
If a motion actuator is experie ncing a tension load that would act to extend the actuator, the RTH amplifier will use the 48 VDC battery system to retract the actuator until the tension load is removed and the actuator can settle home under the force of gravity. Exit of persons from th e motion system is safest when all motion actuators are fully retracted and the machine builder’s draw bridge can be used.The 48 VDC battery system is tested at every engage of the motion system.Hydraulic Cushion - Each motion actuator has an integrated hydraulic cushion that operates in the retract and extend directions to limit the acceleration of the actuator as it approaches the mechanical stop.The hydraulic cushion are outside of the normal operating range of the actuators and only effect motion of the actuators under class 2 fault conditions as the actuators retract/extend to the mechanical stops in response to the loads applied by the system payload and the force of gravity.
The integrity of the hydraulic cushion is monitored by the Moog Simulation Software on every disengage of the system. Dynamic Br aking – As part of the class 2 fault reaction of the system, the CSA servo drives are disconnected from control of the actuators.Once this occurs, the actua tors will move in response to the loads applied by the system payload and t he force of gravity.Dynamic br aking limits the maximum velocity the actuators can achieve after a class 2 fault has occurred.EMO/Interlock – These inputs to the Motion Control C abinet allow the machine builder to connect safety devices that can initiate the class 2 fault reaction of the motion system.The class 2 fault reaction is a category 1 stop as defined in EN ISO 13850.Thermal Monitoring – The motion system monitors temp erature sensing devices in the CSA servo drives, actuators, and regen resistors to ensure the system is operating within its allowable conditions.
The system creates a fault condition if a component’s temperature is outside of the allowable range. 4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 20 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4 - PURPOSE This section discusses the operation of various components that reside within the Motion Control Cabinet .All connections and LEDs associated with these components are listed along with a description of the component.4.1 CSA SERVO DRIVE ASSEMBLY The CSA drive assembly consists of a power stage and a control head.Together they operate to transform the posi tion command received over the Ethercat fieldbus into a PWM current signal to EMAs.Refer to the CSA User’s Manual, CDS 36294 for additional details.Warning: Capacitors in the Servo drives may retain hazardous voltage for some time after power is rem oved.

4.1.1.1.4 J1 – RS232 Interface J1 is an RS232 interface w hich can be used to set interface with the software programming and configuration of the control head. This interface is not required for the normal lifecycle of the machine.4.1.1.1.5 J4 – Motor encoder connector J4 is used to connect the EMA encoder cable.This provides the control head with EMA position feedback and access to the data stored on the encoder EEPROM.Installation of this connection is referenced in section 5 of this manual.CAUTION : DO NOT ATTACH CONNEC T OR DISCONNECT THE J4 CONNECTION WHILE THE CONTROL HE AD IS POWERED AS THI S WILL RESULT IN DAM AGE TO THE EQUIPEMENT 4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 24 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4.1.1.1.6 J2A- Drive Digital Inputs J2A consists of 8 inputs and a common connection which serves as a signal reference.This machine uses only input I1.Input I 1 serves as a hardware enable signal.
24 VDC is supplied by the PLC when the drive should be enabled, the signal is 0VDC otherwise. The hardware enable alone does not enable the drive as a software enable must also be provided.However, the drive must have 24 VDC at J2A I1 to be enabled.4.1.1.1.7 J2C – Drive Ready Relay J2C provides connections to both sides of a d ry contact relay inside of the control head.The relay closes when the drive is clear of faults and has 480VAC power applied, otherwise it is open.24VDC is applied to one side of the relay and the signal at the other side is monitored by the PLC to dete rmine the status of the drives.4.1.1.1.8 Ethercat In/Out The Ethercat in/out connections are used to connect the Ethercat fieldbus to all motion system drives.The drives are connected in a line, with the MCC connecting to drive A (far left drive when looking at the front of the cabinet).The Ethercat out of drive A then connects to Ethercat in of drive B.This pattern repeats for all drives.
There is no connection to Ethercat out of drive F as it is the last drive in the line. 4.1.1.1.9 Ethercat status LEDs The Ethercat status LEDs indicate the status of the Ethercat communications for each drive Run – this LED should be lit whenever the control head is powered Link ACT 0 – this LED will flash on and off whenever the Ethercat In connection is made to another drive or to the MCC .All drives should always have this LED flashing during normal operation Link ACT 1 – this LED will flash on and off whenever the Ethercat Out connection is made to another drive.All drives, except drive F should always have this LED flashing during normal operation.This LED should never be flashing on drive F Error – this LED will be on whenever an error is detected in the Ethercat communications.It does not indicate that there is a connection i ssue within the Ethercat line.4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 25 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.

4.2 Safety PLC Assembly The Siemens ET 200S PLC is the central logic device in the cabinet. It is responsible for controlling the power routing devices in the control electronics, providing hardware enables for the CSA drives and RTHs, monitoring the status of all components in the cabinet and the sensors on the motion mechanics, providing feedback to the motion control computer, controlling visual/audible statu s indicators to the user, controlling relay outputs to the user and acting on user inputs such as EMO , interlocks, and inhibits.Much of the safety functionality of the system is managed by the safety rated modules of the PLC.The PLC communicates with the motion control computer using Ethernet.All PLC inputs/outputs and several intermediate values are communicated to the motion control computer.There are several different operating sequences for the PLC that are requested by the motion control compute r (battery test, system reset, power on/enable, power off/disable).
These sequences are described in section 7.4 of this manual. The safety PLC controls the class 2 fault reaction, described in section 7.4.5.3 of this manual, for any Class 2 fault.4.2.1 PLC Modules CPU 30K1 Power Module 30K2 Digital Input 30K3 Digital Input 30K4 Digital Input 30K5 Digital Input 30K6 Digital Input 30K7 Digital Input 30K8 Digital Input 30K9 Digital Input 30K10 Digital Input 3011 Digital Input 30K12 Analog Input 30K13 Safe Digital Input 30K14 Safe Digital Input 30K15 Power Module 31K1 Digital Output 31K2 Digital Output 31K3 Digital Output 31K4 Digital Output 31K5 Relay Output 31K6 Relay Output 31K7 Power Module 31K8 Safe Digital Output 31K9 Safe Relay Output 31K10 TerminatorDigital Input 31K11 Digital Input 31K12 Digital Input 31K13 Digital Input 31K14 Digital Input 31K15 Analog Input 31K16 Safe Digital Input 31K17 Safe Digital Output 31K18 Figure 4-4 PLC Assembly The Safety PLC assembly is a series of modules connected together.

The modules with a yellow label are safe modules, and the modules with a blue label are standard modules.The number of PLC modules varies with the cabinet design, but all cabinets use the same types of PLC module s.The power modules are 30K2, 31K1, 31K8 , (and 31K19 for –3xxA cabinets) .They have the light gray wire terminals.Each power module powers the group of I/O modules to the right of it (up until the next power module).
30K2 powers input modules 30K3 through 30K15 . 31K1 powers all of the standard outputs, 31K8 powers a mix of safe output , safe input, standard input, and analog input modules (31K9 through 31K18) , and 31K19 powers a mix of input and output modules (31K20 through 31K23) .Under norma l operation for the power modules, the red SF (fault) LED should be OFF and the green PWR (power on) LED should be ON.There are 3 different types of input modules : Modules 30K3 through 30K12 and 31K11 through 31K15 (and 31K20 & 31K21 for -3xxA cabinets ) are standard 8 channel digital input modules.Under normal operation, the red SF (fault) LED for all should be OFF.Module s 30K13 and 31K16 are a 2 channel analog voltage input module.Under normal operation, the red SF (fault) LED for all should be OFF .Modules 30K14 , 30K15 , and 31K17 are safe 8 channel (or 4 redundant channel) input modules.
Each of these two modules have 2 output signals, 1VsF and 2VsF that can be returned through a dry contact of the monitored device to achieve a higher performance level in accordance with the European Machinery directive 2006/42/EC. The output signals are pulse modulated at a specific frequency to detect short circuit conditions.Under normal operation, the red SF LED, the 1VsF LED, and the 2VsF LED should all be O FF.4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 30 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.There are 4 different types of output modules : Modules 31K2 through 31K5 are standard 8 channel digital output modules.Modules 31K6 and 31K7 are standard 2 channel relay output modules.Module s 31K9 and 31K18 (and 31K22 for -3xxA cabinets) are safe 4 channel digital output module s.31K9 controls sing le channel safe relay output module 31K10 , and 31K22 controls single channel safe relay output module 31K23.
Module 31K10 (and 31K23 for -3xxA cabinets) are single channel safe relay output module s. Under normal operation, the red SF (fault) LED for all output modules should be OFF.All modules unplug from their terminals for easy replacement with all wiring intact.For details on PLC module replacement, please refer to the repair procedures sectio n.The actual I/O status for each PLC input and output module is represented on the module’s numbered LED’s.If a module is fault ed or removed from the safety PLC rack, the system will report the module where the error has occurred.4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 31 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4.3 Return to Home (RTH) Controller It is possible that the motion platform may fault in a position that leaves one or more a ctuators in tension.Without the RTH amplifiers , the motion pla tform may be left in a position that makes exiting the motion system difficult.
Moog emplo ys a patented RTH system of independent sensor -less amplifiers for each axis which drives the motion platform to the home position. These amplifiers are sized to provide sufficient force to overcome the maximum tension load and operate from an independent 48 volt battery supply.Warning: Capacitors in the RTH may retain hazardous voltage for some time after power is removed.Wait at least 10 min utes after power off, and verify voltage is not present prior to servicing RTH J1 Conn ector Status LEDs Figure 4-5 Return to Home (RTH) Controller 4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 32 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4.3.1 Return to Home Amplifier I/O Descriptions The following sections provide details of the various I/O of the RTH 4.3.1.1 External Connectors Table 4-4 - RTH Terminal Block J1 Connections Pins Signal Name Description 1 & 2 +24V FLOAT Input: Supply voltage for RTH logic circuits.

Warning: Regen resistors can become very hot during operation. Prior to performing any service to the resistors or around the resistors, verify the temperature is safe to touch.4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 43 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4.9 Dynamic Brake Resistors The dynamic brake resistors limit actuator velocity after a power loss to the actuator s.A power loss can be the result of an emergency stop, fault condition or loss of incoming AC power to the Motion Control Cabinet .There are two resistors for each actuator that are placed in parallel.One resistor is connected through contactors 6K7 (Axis A and B), 6K8 (Axis C and D) and 6K9 (Axis E and F) .The second is connected through the respective RTH controller for that a xis.The resistance of the actuators is factory set to provide a safe settling velocity during an Emergency stop, fault or power loss reaction.
The two resistors a re put into circuit with a small time delay in between to allow for a more subtle onset of the dynamic braking. Dynamic brake resistors are located behind the far left and far right rear cabinet panels.Figure 4-13 Dynamic Brake Resistors 4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 44 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4.10 Bus Bars The Motion Contr ol Cabinet uses bus bars to transfer power throughout the cabinet .One runs along the bottom of the front side of the cabinet and distributes 3 phase AC power to each CSA servo drive.The conductive bars are located behind the protective plastic case.AC power is applied to the bus bar at the mains connection and is supplied to each CSA drive at the six drive feeds.The AC power connection to the bus bar is after contactors 79K1 and 7 9K2.Both the mains connection and the drive feeds can be accessed through removable covers.
A ground bar is also present along the bottom of the front side of the cabinet. This bar is a physical earth connection for the cabinet and as such it does not r equire a protective case.3 Phase AC bus bar behind plastic cover Mains connection Physical Earth Bar CSA Drive Feeds Figure 4-14 AC Bus Bar and Physical Earth Ground The other bus bar runs along the bottom of the rear side of the cabinet and distributes DC power to t he RTH amplifiers .The mains of the DC bus bar connect the 48VDC battery bus.There is also an auxiliary connection from the CSA drive of Axis F.DC is applied to each RTH amplifier at the six RTH feeds.As with the 3 phase AC bus bar, the bars are beh ind a plastic cover and the mains connection, auxiliary connection and RTH feeds can be accessed through removable covers.Figure 4-15 DC Bus Bar 4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 45 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.
4.11 Circuit Breakers and Fuses The Motion Control Cabinet contains circuit breakers and fuses as required to safely distribute power throughout the cabinet. Although most are resettable circuit breakers, a few fuses are used.The fuse table located on the inside of the far right cabine t door provides ordering details should a fuse need to be replaced.The state of all circuit breakers and fuses are monitored by the safety PLC to provide the user with a detailed report of which device has tripped.4.12 Contactors and Relays The Motion Con trol Cabinet contains several contactors and relays to manage the power flow through the cabinet.The state of each is monitored by the safety PLC where it is compared to the commanded state.If the commanded and observed states are not in agreement, a f ault is issued.
4.13 48 VDC Battery System The 48 VDC battery system is comprised of four 12VDC batteries in series (7C1 – 7C4), either two 24VDC battery changers (5C1, 5C2) or one 48VDC charger (5C1) depending upon cabinet model, and a battery load resistor (7R1). The 48VDC is used by the RTH amplifiers to retract the actuators from a tensile load during the system’s class 2 fault reaction.4.13.1 Battery Bank Figure 4-16 48VDC Battery Bank 4 Sub-Component Operation CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 46 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.4.13.2 Battery Chargers for -127-358 (5C1 & 5C2) The battery chargers continually maintain the voltage of the 48 VDC battery bank while the cabinet is powered.The exception is during the loaded battery test when the chargers are disconnected.The output of each battery charger is monitored by the safety PLC.A fault is issued if the output is not present.The loss of a battery charger output can typically only be observed during the loaded battery test .

They are the lowest alarm level and represent conditions that are either expected during normal operation of the system or that do not indicate a fault of the system. Therefore they are not referred to as faults.If an inhibit is active when the system is engaged, a disengage (as described in section 7.4.3 of this manual) will automatically be performed.If an inhibit is active while the system is not engaged, it will not be possible to engage the motion system.An Inhibit will clear automatically when the condition that caused the inhibit is no longer present.7.4.5.2 Class 1 Class 1 alarms are referred to a s class 1 faults.They represent failures of the system that, at least temporarily, do not affect the system’s ability to perform a servo drive controlled disengage.If a class 1 alarm is active when the system is engaged, a disengage (as described in section 7.4.3 of this manual) will automatically be performed.
If a class 1 alarm is active while the system is not engaged, it will not be possib le to engage the motion system.

If the control cabinet is going to be inactive for a long period of time (several months), the batteries should be recharged as soon as possible and not stored in a discharged state. Batteries should be recharged every six months when not in u se and If possible, be stored at 20°C (68°F) or lower.Figure 9-8 RTH Battery Shelf Life and Storage 9 Scheduled Maintenance CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 127 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.9.1.2.7 UPS Batteries Maintenance Battery life will be reduced the longer batteries sit without the charge being maintained.Whenever possible, the Motion Control Cabinet should be powered on to maintain a charge.Moog recommends that the UPS batteries be charged within 6 months of storage.See Figure 9-9 UPS Battery for important manufacturer recommendations regarding battery maintenance.
NOTE: If the UPS will not be powered for more than 3 months, the internal fuses should be removed and the ( -) wire p ulled from both UPS battery units (2C1) and (2C 2) to prevent current drain.

Shut down the system per section 7.4.4 and wait at least 10 minutes before proceeding. 2.Make small, incremental adjustments (0.1 ohm) to both resistors 3.Check the settling rate .4.Repeat as necessary.11.1.2 Decreasing resistors 1.Shut down the system per section 7.4.4 and wait at least 10 minutes before proceeding .2.Make small, incremental adjustments (0.1 ohm) to the contactor re sistor ( 11R2 ) first .3.Check the settling rate .4.If further adjustment is required, reduce the value of the RTH A resistor ( 11R1 ) by the same amount .5.Test the result and repeat as necessary .6.Repeat these steps for the resistors for axes B through F.CAUTION: THE RTH RESISTOR MUS T NOT BE ADJUSTED TO A LOWER VALUE THAN THE CONTACTOR R ESISTOR .DO NOT REDUCE THE VA LUE OF EITHER RESISTOR TO LESS THA N 3.0 OHMS NOTE: The reduction in speed is nonlinear.As the resistance is decreased, the inductive reactance of the rotating motor increasingly dominates overall circuit impedance.
As the resistor values are reduced, their effect on reducing velocity is decreased. NOTE: The system relies upon the contactor brake to reduce the initial velocity, so that the current resulting from the application of bus voltage (proportional to motor speed) to the RTH resistor will not result in peak currents in excess of 240 A.11 Addendums CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 168 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.11.2 Torque Specifications Torque specifications for the various connections are listed in the table below Table 11-1 - Torque Specifications Terminal in-lbs Nm Batteries 130 15 DRIVE - RR & +ATP 40 4.5 DRIVE - U1, V1, W1 53-71 6-8 DRIVE 24V Fan 5-7 .5-.8 DRIVE P.E.(2x) 53-71 6-8 RTH - TB1 32 3.6 RTH – J1 5 .5 Main Disconnect 1Q1 - 1, 2, 3 200 22.6 Motor Power Terminals -10X3, -13X1, -16X1, -19X2, -22X1, -25X1 31 3.5 11 Addendums CDS46008 Revision A November 2016 169 Moog Motion System Users’ Manual Moog Inc.

Title: Focus on threat of Israel’s nuclear arsenal: Iran embassy in London rejects Telegraph’s 'lies' Datetime: 20250209_171900 Content: Iran’s Embassy in London has firmly rejected the unfounded allegations made by the British dailyTelegraph, asserting that Iran’s nuclear program is entirely peaceful and that nuclear weapons have “no place” in its defense doctrine.The embassy issued a statement on Sunday following aTelegrapharticle that claimed Iranian military commanders had privately urged the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, to revoke his fatwa (religious decree) banning the production of nuclear weapons.Describing the allegations as “beyond absurdity,” the embassy characterized the report as part of a broader disinformation campaign against the Islamic Republic.“TheTelegraphhas turned itself into an apparatus for a malign disinformation campaign against Iran,” the statement read, which was posted on the social media platform X.
The Telegraph has turned itself into an apparatus for a malign disinformation campaign against Iran.We reject all the claims and accusations it has disseminated on Iran's nuclear programme throughout the past month, including the one published yesterday which is truly beyond…pic.twitter.com/kW8cP9kneT “We reject all the claims and accusations it has disseminated on Iran's nuclear programme throughout the past month, including the one published yesterday which is truly beyond absurdity,” it added. Reiterating the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear activities, the embassy noted, “Iran’s nuclear program is absolutely peaceful and is part of Iran's national plan for scientific, technological, and industrial development.” “WMDs (weapons of mass destruction), in particular nuclear weapons, have no place in our defense doctrine and are prohibited under our religious beliefs and national values,” it stated.
The embassy advised the British media, not least theTelegraph,to instead focus on the “imminent threat” posed by Israel’s arsenal of nuclear weapons to international peace and security. “Please stop spreading lies and smokescreening the real and imminent threat to world peace, namely Israel's nuclear arsenal, militancy, and lawless behavior,” it said.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran will continue to support resistance front until ultimate victory: Top security official Datetime: 20250209_180300 Content: Iran’s top security official says the Islamic Republic will continue its support for the resistance front until its ultimate victory in Palestine and Lebanon.Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Ali Akbar Ahmadian made the remark in a meeting with the Chairman of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas Shura Council Muhammad Ismail Darwish and its other members in Tehran on Sunday.
He hailed Hamas's victory against Israel, saying the developments in Gaza indicated that "Israel is destined to be destroyed and 470 days of resistance proved that this goal can be achieved." Pointing to Hamas's achievements in the international scene, the SNSC secretary said, “Today, we see that the entire world and even European and Western officials acknowledge the rights of the Palestinian people.” “Such an atmosphere did not exist before the Al-Aqsa Flood operation. This achievement is the result of the victory of blood over the sword,” Ahmadian added, referring to the operation launched on October 7, 2023, by Palestinian resistance fighters against the Israeli regime.He noted that the people of Gaza, with their exemplary resistance, have become a role model for themselves and future generations.
In a meeting on Saturday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei told the visiting Hamas delegation that the Palestinian resistance defeated Israel and the US in their war on Gaza, and made a “great achievement” by securing a ceasefire. “God Almighty granted you and the people of Gaza honor and victory, and made Gaza an example of the noble verse that says, 'How many a small company has overcome a large company by permission of Allah',” the Leader said.Operation Al-Aqsa Flood destroyed myth of Israeli military invincibility: Darwish The chairman of Hamas Shura Council said during the Operation al-Aqsa Flood, the Palestinian fighters succeeded in standing up to Israel and the United States with limited resources and shattering the myth of the invincibility of the Israeli regime’s military power.
Darwish added that Israel’s deterrence has reached a state of strategic fragility after Operation al-Aqsa Flood, which was the result of the resistance moves in Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran's direct military operations. During the operation, he emphasized, the US had no option but to fully support the Israeli regime which was on the verge of collapse.He emphasized that Hamas is preparing for the next phase of war as it has not ended yet.Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has resulted in the death of at least 48,189 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injury of 111,640 others since early October 2023.A ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement went into effect in Gaza on January 19, halting Israel’s aggressive campaign against the coastal region.The first 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement calls for 33 Israeli captives and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners to be released.
So far, the agreement has held, but US President Donald Trump’s proposal to clear Gaza of its inhabitants and take over the territory is creating hiccups amid widespread denunciation around the world. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran hails historic resistance of Gazans against Israeli genocide Datetime: 20250210_012100 Content: Iran’s foreign minister says Israel failed to achieve its goals in the 15-month-long genocidal war on Gaza.Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday the Israeli regime was finally forced to sit for talks and come to an agreement with the same movement it was seeking to annihilate.Araghchi was speaking at a meeting with members of the leadership council of the Hamas resistance movement.He said Hamas managed to compel the enemy to accept a ceasefire based on conditions laid out by the resistance.“Despite committing barbaric crimes and killing thousands of women, children and defenseless people, the Zionist regime was forced to negotiate and agree with a movement that it intended to completely destroy,” he said.
“The occupying regime failed to achieve its goals, and Hamas, relying on the power of faith and its popular position, was able to force the enemy to accept a ceasefire based on the conditions of the resistance and the release of Palestinian prisoners who had been held captive by the aggressor regime for years,” the top Iranian diplomat said. Araghchi added that the resistance of the people of Gaza against the Zionist regime’s unprecedented genocide will be remembered in history.“The resistance and perseverance of the people of Gaza in this small area against the unprecedented genocide of the Zionist regime will be recorded and immortalized in history, and the power of resistance, which was crystallized in the scenes of the return of the patient Palestinian people to their land, is a source of pride and honor for all Muslims and freedom-loving people in the world,” Araghchi said.
The Iranian foreign minister reiterated that US President Donald Trump's plan to force Palestinians out of Gaza is in line with the colonial conspiracy of eliminating Palestine, and is totally unacceptable. Araqchi referred to his telephone calls with the Secretary General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Hissein Brahim Taha and the foreign ministers of some Arab and Islamic countries to follow up on holding an emergency meeting of the Organization’s foreign ministers.He emphasized “the need for Islamic countries to adopt a coherent and decisive stance against this dangerous conspiracy.” Darwish thanks Iran for supporting Palestinians For his part, the head of the Hamas delegation, Muhammad Ismail Darwish, thanked Iran’s Supreme Leader, government, and nation for supporting Palestinians.
He praised the leaders and commanders of the resistance, especially the martyrs Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammad Deif, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Sayyed Hashem Safi al-Din, and thousands of Palestinian, Lebanese, Iraqi, Yemeni, and Iranian mujahideen, and of course, the martyr General Hajj Qassem Soleimani, who sacrificed their lives for the holy cause of Palestine in confronting the crimes of the Zionist regime. He described the victory of the resistance over Israel as “a turning point in the history of Palestine,” which resulted in inflicting a strategic defeat on the occupying regime and resulted in widespread global support for the Palestinian people.Darwish added that nobody can force the people of Gaza out of their land.He condemned the US president’s plan to evacuate people from Gaza, The head of the Hamas leadership council recalled the need for Arab and Islamic countries to adopt a firm and united stance in opposing these plans and supporting the Palestinian people.
"No one can expel our resilient people, who were able to resist the crimes and aggression of the Zionist regime during more than fifteen months of continuous genocide and return victoriously to their cities and regions, from Gaza because our people are rooted in their land and homeland like olive trees," he stated. Darwish appreciated the vibrant Iranian foreign policy in supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people in international forums, and “expressed hope that with the completion of the ceasefire agreement process, we will witness the formation of a regional and global campaign to support the reconstruction of Gaza and heal the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iranians mark 46th anniversary of Islamic Revolution with nationwide marches, celebrations Datetime: 20250210_063200 Content: In a display of national unity and unwavering revolutionary spirit, millions of Iranians from all walks of life have taken to the streets across the country to commemorate the 46th anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The various commemoration events and celebrations, which were held on Monday, were imbued with fervor and patriotic zeal, showcasing the deep-rooted allegiance of the Iranian people to the values and principles that shaped the Islamic Republic following the Revolution’s victory.From the sprawling metropolis of Tehran to the remotest villages, citizens participated in mass marches, carrying banners, waving the national flag, and chanting slogans echoing the indelible legacy of the Revolution that overthrew the United States-backed tyrannical Pahlavi monarchy.
The waves of demonstrators converged on iconic spots, such as the capital’s Azadi Square and Enqelab Square, filling the air with resounding chants of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel,” reiterating Iran’s steadfast opposition to foreign interference, imperialist hegemony, and Western-backed occupation and aggression. Senior officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian as well as military and religious figures, are slated to address the nation on the occasion that marks drawn-out religious fervor and struggle on the part of Iranians against the Pahlavi regime under the guidance of the revered late founder of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini.The addresses are expected to underscore, among other things, the country’s unwavering support for oppressed nations, particularly the peoples of Palestine, Yemen, and Lebanon, in line with the Revolution’s overall anti-imperialist vision.
Across various cities, students, religious scholars, and families of martyrs, who gave their lives towards enabling the Revolution’s victory or its preservation, paid homage to the sacrifices that were made in defense of the development, while reaffirming their unshakable commitment to Imam Khomeini’s ideals. Observers say the victory of the Revolution on February 11, 1979 marked the dawn of a new era in Iran’s history, one that dismantled decades of Western-backed deadly oppression and replaced it with a ruling structure rooted in Islamic principles and popular sovereignty.They say the Revolution remains a beacon of defiance against global arrogance, serving as an inspiration to oppressed nations worldwide.They also underline the development’s enduring significance that has been witnessed by the Islamic Republic's successful defeating of decades of US-led conspiracies aimed at undermining its sovereignty following the Revolution’s victory.
The Islamic Republic, however, has continued to thrive in the face of the persistent attempts aimed at undermining the Revolution or stifling Iran’s progress, which have included economic sanctions, psychological warfare and an eight-year heavily-Western-supported war by Iraq.

Title: Iran urges world to oppose ‘dangerous’ US-Israeli plot to ethnically cleanse Gaza Datetime: 20250210_064300 Content: Iran’s foreign minister has strongly condemned the US-Israeli plot of ethnically cleansing Palestinians from Gaza, and expelling them from the war-wracked besieged territory, calling on the international community to vigorously oppose the ploy.Abbas Araghchi made the remark in a Sunday phone conversation with Gambia’s Foreign Minister Mamadou Tangara, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).Araghchi censured the “dangerous, criminal and inhuman” plan which “runs counter to all international principles and regulations.” Pointing to his talks with the OIC secretary general and his counterparts from Arab and Muslim countries, the top Iranian diplomat called on Gambia to make efforts to hold an emergency meeting of the organization’s foreign ministers to address the issue.
During a meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced his plan to seize the Palestinian region of Gaza and evict its natives from their homeland. Trump’s plan also included the people of Gaza being forcibly relocated to Egypt and Jordan, despite the fact that both countries have officially rejected the scheme.The Gambian foreign minister, for his part, hailed Iran’s attention to the Palestinian issue and welcomed the country’s proposal for an emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the OIC member countries.Tangara added that he will consult and coordinate with other OIC member countries in this regard.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: President Pezeshkian: Iran will thwart all enemies’ plots Datetime: 20250210_084700 Content: Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says the Islamic Republic will strive to thwart all plots hatched by the enemies.The Iranian president made the remark while addressing a huge crowd of people marking the 46th anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Tehran on Monday.He criticized US President Donald Trump’s recent claim that he wishes to hold talks with Iran while simultaneously issuing a presidential memorandum that instructs the US Treasury and State Department to implement a campaign aimed at “driving Iran’s oil exports to zero.” “Trump says let’s have a dialogue, and then … he signs and announces all possible conspiracies to bring the [Islamic] Revolution to its knees,” the president said.
Trump claims that Iran is disrupting regional security but “it is Israel that, with the support of the United States, is the root cause of insecurity and bombs the oppressed people of Gaza, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Iran and wherever it wishes,” he added. The US president claims to defend peace and tranquility but he defends a criminal who has been convicted by international organizations, Pezeshkian said, referring to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Enemies will take their wish to harm Iran to grave: Pezeshkian Pezeshkian warned that the enemies and ill-wishers seek to sow discord in Iran and instill the belief of Iran's weakness in the minds of the people and pretend that today is “the best time to harm the country.” “However, they are unaware that, under the leadership of Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and with the constant presence and sacrifices of the [Iranian] people, they will bring all these dreams and wishes to grave,” he emphasized. He said Iran has powerfully resisted bullying and will stand up to conspiracies aimed at sowing discord and division.Iran will never bow to enemies Pezeshkian said Iran has never sought to wage a war against any country and would never bow to the enemies.He added that the enemies are afraid of Iran’s unity and coherence, noting that Iranians would be able to solve all of the problems if they forge national unity.
Iran would never allow enemies to implement their ominous objectives, the president asserted. He reiterated Iran’s resolve to have peaceful coexistence with its neighbors based on fraternity and mutual respect.“If we defend Gaza and Palestine, we are defending the oppressed.If you seek [to promote] peace in the region, do not defend oppression, aggression and injustice,” he said.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Debunking misconceptions: Islamic Republic of Iran's reality vs Western portrayals Datetime: 20250210_102400 Content: By Nahid Poureisa In much of the mainstream Western media, Iran is often portrayed as a backward country, a place where the Islamic Revolution of 1979 brought about oppression, particularly towards women, and trapped the nation in a grip of authoritarianism.The image painted is that of a nation in decay, with its women silenced and its people suffering under an "oppressive regime." However, this depiction does not reflect the reality on the ground, where the country has since the 1979 Islamic Revolution made significant strides in various spheres despite external pressures in different forms.Today marks the 46th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, a historic moment when the Iranian people overthrew the West-backed Pahlavi regime—a corrupt, oppressive monarchy that served only its own interests and those of a small, privileged elite.
The revolution was not just a resistance to foreign influence but a movement to liberate the Iranian people from decades of exploitation and neglect. For too long, the Pahlavi regime, a puppet of Western powers, reigned over a nation in turmoil, pushing policies that deepened inequality and stifled progress.The narrative in the West, which portrays the Islamic Revolution as a step backward for the country, fails to take into account the brutality and injustice of the regime that was overthrown in a popular movement.Iranians mark 46th anniversary of Islamic Revolution with nationwide marches, celebrations#IR46https://t.co/nyUf0Drb7M Tyrannical and elitist Pahlavi rule The Pahlavi rule was a tragedy for the Iranian people, a period marked by repression, poverty, and widespread inequality.Under this regime, development was not about uplifting the masses but about enriching a handful of urban elites, who enjoyed a life of luxury while most Iranians suffered.
This system of elitism was a betrayal of the Iranian people, leaving rural areas and ordinary Iranians neglected and women marginalized. Under the Shah regime, only 43 percent of rural areas had electricity by 1978, a shocking example of its failure to invest in the needs of the vast majority.Rural women were left illiterate, with a staggering 94 percent unable to read or write.Healthcare was a privilege of the rich, while rural areas—home to most of the population—had no access to basic medical services.Maternal mortality rates were atrocious, exceeding 200 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1978, a clear sign of the regime’s indifference to the lives of ordinary Iranians.Education under the Shah regime was another tool of oppression.Higher education was reserved for the urban elite, leaving rural children—especially girls—without opportunities to improve their lives.
Women were excluded from higher education and professional careers, settling as second-class citizens in a society that had long since abandoned any pretense of equality. The 1979 Islamic Revolution was the beginning of a multi-stage process to restore the golden age of Islamic civilization.46 years on, Revolution remains a living and evolving force, its struggle for justice continuing as long as injustice persists.#IR46pic.twitter.com/2G16OLYui0 Empowerment of women by Islamic Revolution The Islamic Revolution in 1979 led by Imam Khomeini marked a turning point, a break from the Shah’s oppressive policies, and a massive leap toward justice and equality.The popular revolution shifted the focus to the Iranian people as a whole, particularly the women who had been subjugated for so long under the Shah’s rule.Before the revolution, rural women’s literacy was a dismal 6 percent.
By 2016, that number soared to 83 percent, thanks to massive investments in education, teacher training programs, and schools built in rural areas. Today, over 60 percent of university students in Iran are women, excelling in different fields, including medicine, engineering, and science.In fact, Iranian women have made remarkable strides in STEM fields, with Iran leading the region in women’s representation in science and technology.Women’s health also saw dramatic improvements after the Islamic Revolution.Maternal mortality, which had been a devastating consequence of the Shah regime's neglect, dropped from over 200 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1978 to just 16 by 2020.Life expectancy for women increased from 54 years in 1978 to 78 years in 2020—a testament to the success of expanded healthcare initiatives that the Shah regime had deliberately ignored.

By 2020, over 99 percent of rural homes were electrified, and clean water projects reached even the most remote villages.More than 200,000 kilometers of roads were constructed, connecting rural areas to cities, improving access to markets, education, and healthcare.Under the Shah regime, rural Iran was left to wither, but the revolution provided essential infrastructure and services, proving that development can and should be for everyone, not just the rich and powerful.Over 17,000 rural health houses were built, providing primary healthcare to communities that had been abandoned by the Pahlavi regime for decades.
Explainer: Why Iranians favored Imam Khomeini and the Islamic democratic rule instead of the US-backed Pahlavi monarchy#IR46pic.twitter.com/WennGcDWQ3 Environmental sustainability: A vision for the future Iran has made remarkable strides in environmental sustainability since 1979, driven by the 15 environmental directives issued by Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, to promote ecological care and a green future. These directives provide the framework for a comprehensive approach to addressing environmental challenges, including desertification, pollution, and climate change.Some of the key elements of these directives are: Sustainable Development: Incorporating environmental care into national development plans, ensuring a balance between economic growth and ecological preservation.
Forest Conservation: Preventing the destruction of forests and promoting reforestation initiatives, including programs like the "One Billion Tree Planting Initiative." Energy Efficiency: Promoting the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and cut emissions. Biodiversity Protection: Efforts to protect endangered species and natural habitats, ensuring the survival of Iran’s unique flora and fauna.Green Technology: Encouraging the development of green technologies and sustainable agricultural practices to reduce environmental harm.Eco-Friendly Urban Development: Designing cities and infrastructure to minimize environmental impact, with an emphasis on green spaces and sustainable transportation.Climate Change Mitigation: Developing policies to address and adapt to the impacts of climate change, especially in the context of Iran's vulnerable ecosystems.
Environmental Education: Raising public awareness about the importance of environmental conservation and sustainable practices. Protecting Marine Ecosystems: Ensuring the preservation of Iran’s coastal and marine resources, particularly in the Persian Gulf.One example of these directives in action is the “One Billion Tree Planting Initiative,” which aims to combat desertification, restore ecosystems, and improve quality of air.This project focuses on reforestation in arid regions and urban greening efforts to address air pollution and climate change.The initiative exemplifies Iran’s long-term commitment to environmental sustainability and showcases how the country’s leadership has integrated ecological care into national development.
#IR46: How Iran industrialized and modernized construction sector with domestic expertiseBy@kesic_ivan#IR46https://t.co/li4Q4Hu7eE Confronting economic challenges Despite all these achievements since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran also faces significant challenges, especially in the economic sector. US-led sanctions have inflicted over $200 billion in economic losses, and inflation, currency devaluation, and neoliberal economic policies continue to strain the population.The over-reliance on oil exports, a legacy of the Shah regime's corrupt economic system, has made the country vulnerable to global market fluctuations.Nevertheless, Iran’s resilience remains unmatched.The country has become a leader in fields such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, and renewable energy, demonstrating its ability to innovate despite sanctions.Women have played a crucial role in these advancements, contributing to scientific and technological progress.
The 1979 Iranian Revolution was not a movement against progress, as Western pundits have often suggested. It was a revolution for progress, national sovereignty, and equity.The overthrow of the Shah’s West-backed regime marked the beginning of a new era for Iran, one focused on the empowerment of its people.While Iran continues to face economic challenges primarily due to illegal American sanctions, the achievements of the 1979 Islamic Revolution cannot be ignored.Women’s education and health have vastly improved, rural development has flourished, and environmental sustainability is being prioritized.Iran’s progress, driven by the hard work and resilience of its people, proves that the revolution was not only necessary but transformative.As we commemorate the 46th anniversary of the revolution, let’s acknowledge that Iran is not the backward, oppressive nation that Western media often portrays.
It is a country that, despite enormous challenges, has moved toward progress, development, and empowerment. The legacy of the revolution endures, and its impact is clear in the progress Iran has made over the past 46 years.Nahid Poureisais an Iranian analyst and academic researcher focused on West Asia and China.(The views expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect those of Press TV.)

Title: ‘No talks under pressure’: FM hails Leader’s wise stance on negotiations Datetime: 20250210_105200 Content: Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has emphasized that the Islamic Republic would never engage in negotiations under pressure as per Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei’s stance on talks that is entirely based on logic and strategic reasoning.Speaking at a rally in the western Iranian city of Hamadan marking the 46th anniversary of the victory of Iran’s Islamic Revolution on Monday, Araghchi rejected calls for negotiations from the United States, particularly under the administration of Donald Trump, describing them as deceptive.“The Islamic Revolution was founded to ensure that no foreign power could dictate terms to the Iranian people and their leaders,” he stated.
“The core principle of our foreign policy is ‘Neither East, nor West,’ which means independence from all global powers, not disengagement.” Araghchi made it clear that the Islamic Republic had no trust in negotiations with the US, given Washington’s history of failing to uphold agreements. “Iran negotiated in good faith and reached an agreement, but the outcome was nothing but non-compliance and withdrawal by the other party,” he said, referring to Washington’s unilateral and illegal exit from a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers.The top diplomat emphasized that refusing to negotiate with the United States was, therefore, a calculated and expert-driven decision, not an act of stubbornness or an emotional reaction.‘Trusting US again not a rational choice’ "Trusting the US again is not a rational choice.
The Iranian people demanded independence because our country was once entirely dependent on the West and lacked sovereignty," he stated, referring to the country’s situation under its former US-backed Pahlavi regime. Citing an instance of Iran’s submission to Washington under the monarchical regime, he recalled a historical moment."In an interview, when Shah (the former monarch) was asked why he was leaving Iran [amid the imminent prospect of the Revolution’s victory], he responded that 'they ordered me to go,' referring to the Americans.This highlights the extent of foreign influence over our nation before the Revolution." Still referring to standing conflicts with the US, Araghchi asserted, “No nation negotiates under duress unless it intends to surrender.Why should we negotiate while facing threats and sanctions?” he asked.
Araghchi was pointing to Washington’s so-called policy of “maximum pressure” against Tehran, which the former pursues while simultaneously claiming to be open to talks, an approach that Iran categorically dismisses as insincere, untenable, and unworkable. “When they do nothing but impose sanctions and issue threats, what reason do we have to trust them?” he asked.The foreign minister stressed that Iran’s leadership, backed by the will of the people, would never allow external forces to impose their will on the country.Citing a case of prudent relevant leadership savvy, Araghchi praised the Leader’s recent remarks on negotiations, calling them “entirely intelligent and rooted in logic.” He reiterated that accordingly, Iran remained steadfast in resisting coercion and would continue to stand firm against hegemonic pressures.Araghchi, meanwhile, said that today marked not only the anniversary of Iran’s Islamic Revolution, but also a victory for the Gaza Strip.
"The Palestinian people endured 16 months of relentless Zionist pressure. Their resistance forced the illegitimate Israeli regime to concede and agree to [captive/]prisoner exchanges.This is the outcome of steadfast resistance," he asserted.The official was referring to Gaza’s steadfast resistance operations during the regime’s ferocious war of genocide on the Palestinian territory that eventually forced Tel Aviv to accept a ceasefire deal with the coastal sliver’s resistance movement Hamas.He also condemned Trump’s recent announcement of a so-called plan aimed at turning over Gaza’s “ownership” to Washington as a blatant violation of the international law.He also revealed details of a recent meeting in Tehran, where a delegation of Hamas leaders reaffirmed their commitment to their homeland."They told us that the people of Gaza are like olive trees, deeply rooted in their land.
They will never abandon their homeland," Araghchi concluded in reference to the resistance officials, who also attended a meeting with Ayatollah Khamenei. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iranian Armed Forces 'readier than ever' against threats: Top general Datetime: 20250210_112100 Content: Iran’s top general says the country’s Armed Forces are at their utmost readiness to respond to any threat posed by the enemies.Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri made the remarks on Monday, on the sidelines of a rally marking the anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Tehran.“The situation of the Armed Forces is better than ever and they stand ready to respond to any threat,” he said.Asked about the possibility of talks between Iran and the United States, Baqeri said Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei recently announced Tehran’s position in that regard.
Speaking on Friday,Ayatollah Khameneicited the experience of 2015 when Iran and six other countries, including the US, signed the now-dormant Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) after two years of negotiations, only to be discarded by US President Donald Trump in 2018. He said, “Negotiating with such a government is unwise, unintelligent and dishonorable, and there should be no negotiation with it.” On Saturday, Trump warned that he would prefer to make a deal with Iran rather than “bombing the hell out of it.” The threat came days after he restored his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, which he practiced in his first presidential term after unilaterally withdrawing Washington from the JCPOA.Trump’s remarks caused Iranians to attend rally Meanwhile, Chief Commander of the Iranian Army Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi said Trump’s anti-Iran remarks caused those who were not serious to participate in Monday’s rally.
“A large crowd has turned out to punch Trump hard in the mouth,” he added. ‘Iranians do not negotiate under sanctions and threats’ Additionally on Monday, Defense Minister Brigadier General Aziz Nasirzadeh said Iranians do not negotiate under conditions of sanctions and threats.“It is not possible at all to negotiate with the new US administration, and we do not accept them,” he told reporters during the Islamic Revolution’s 46th anniversary march.“Our viewpoint is the same as that of the Leader.Did the Americans stick to their previous agreements?” Asked about the current preparedness of the Armed Forces, Nasirzadeh said threats are “nothing new,” vowing to respond to “any insolent act by the enemy in the strongest possible way.” He was further asked whether Iran has a plan to increase the range of its missiles to more than 2,000 kilometers.The Armed Forces, he emphasized, will do whatever is necessary to ensure the security of the Islamic Republic.

Title: Iran urges UN to take ‘firm, clear’ stance against displacement plot for Gaza Datetime: 20250210_134100 Content: Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says the United Nations, particularly its Security Council, must adopt a “firm and clear” position against the US-Israeli scheme aimed at forcibly displacing Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.In a phone conversation with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, Araghchi condemned the “dangerous” US-Israeli plot, which he said poses a threat to international peace and security.“The proposal to forcibly relocate Palestinians violates all principles and standards of international law and the United Nations Charter, and, in fact, complements the Israeli regime's plan for genocide and the eradication of Palestine,” he said.During a meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 6, US President Donald Trump announced his plan to seize Gaza and evict its natives from their homeland.
Trump’s plan also included the people of Gaza being forcibly relocated to Egypt and Jordan, even though both countries have officially rejected the scheme. Araghchi noted that he has recently held intensive consultations with the foreign ministers of Arab and Muslim countries about the Israeli regime’s plan against the people of Gaza.The top Iranian diplomat said Arab and Muslim countries have strongly condemned the Tel Aviv regime’s forced displacement plan, which reflects their grave concern regarding the “continued gross violation of the Palestinian people’s rights and their genocide in another form.” He censured the recent stance of the Israeli regime’s prime minister, who had called for the displacement of Palestinians to Saudi Arabia, describing it as a clear example of the occupying regime’s “brazen and audacious behavior.” The Iranian foreign minister said the international community must prevent the normalization of the lawlessness and criminality of the occupying regime.
In Washington, Netanyahu suggested that Palestinians should establish their state in Saudi Arabia rather than in their own homeland, dismissing any notion of Palestinian sovereignty. In an official statement on Sunday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry reaffirmed its "categorical rejection" of such rhetoric, emphasizing that "the Palestinian people have a right to their land, and they are not intruders or immigrants who can be expelled whenever the brutal Israeli occupation wishes." UN condemns forced displacement plan of Palestinians Guterres said the United Nations strongly opposes any plan regarding the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza which is “completely rejected and unacceptable.” He underscored the importance of respecting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.
The UN chief said the immediate dispatch of humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged people in Gaza and help to reconstruct the Strip figure high on the UN agenda, saying the UN would spare no efforts in this regard.

Title: Pezeshkian: Caspian Sea cooperation key to ensure shared regional interests Datetime: 20250210_154000 Content: President Masoud Pezeshkian says the Islamic Republic of Iran supports the expansion of cooperation among the Caspian Sea littoral states to ensure common interests and protect the environment.In a phone call on Monday with Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, National Leader of the Turkmen People, Pezeshkian hailed Turkmenistan’s initiative to declare 2025 as the “International Year of Peace and Trust” in the country.“The Islamic Republic of Iran favors the establishment of peace and friendship in the region and throughout the world, and welcomes cooperation with Turkmenistan and other countries in this regard,” the Iranian president said.Pointing to the Iran-Turkmenistan cooperation in the electricity and energy sectors, Pezeshkian said the two countries also enjoy the potential to boost interaction in several other areas such as gas swap and transportation.
Pezeshkian placed a premium on the role the Iran-Turkmenistan Joint Economic Cooperation Commission can play in further developing bilateral relations. For his part, Berdimuhamedov invited the Iranian president to take part in a conference in honor of the International Year of Peace and Trust in Turkmenistan and called for bilateral cooperation to promote peace and friendship in the region and the world.He said Ashgabat and Tehran should enhance economic, cultural and artistic cooperation.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hezbollah hails Iran’s Islamic Revolution as historic turning point in resistance Datetime: 20250210_163100 Content: Hezbollah has extended its congratulations to the Iranian government and nation on the 46th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution, describing this historic event as a turning point and a beacon of resistance.In a statement released on Monday, the Lebanese resistance movement said the Islamic Republic of Iran has been a pillar of resistance for just causes across the West Asia region since its foundation by Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Revolution, in 1979.“It has unwaveringly supported oppressed nations, emerged as a cornerstone of strength for resistance movements, and remained a resolute advocate for the Palestinian cause — now facing intensified attempts by imperialist forces to eradicate it,” Hezbollah noted.
The statement continued that the current US administration enforces and advances plots aimed at erasing the Palestinian issue from the consciousness of the Muslim world. Hezbollah also underscored Iran’s vital role in backing resistance movements, particularly in Lebanon.“Since Hezbollah’s inception in 1982, the Islamic Republic has stood firmly by its side, offering extensive support to facilitate the liberation of occupied territories and the defeat of aggressors.This steadfast commitment has been instrumental in shifting power dynamics and securing pivotal victories that have redefined the region’s strategic equation,” the statement pointed out.
The Lebanese group went on to say that Iran’s Islamic Revolution, led by Imam Khomeini, reshaped history, overturned a regime of tyranny and oppression, and laid the foundations of a strong and independent Muslim state — one that refuses to bow to global hegemonic powers and instead relies on the will of its people as well as its religious and humanitarian principles. Hezbollah reaffirmed that, under its visionary leadership, the Islamic Revolution has steered the Iranian nation toward establishing a formidable and pioneering state.It stated that Iran has attained political sovereignty, scientific innovation, and industrial advancement across multiple domains, despite enduring persistent sanctions, hostilities, and subversive plots.Hezbollah concluded its statement by extending its best wishes to the Islamic Republic, under the leadership of Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, and prayed for its continued strength, progress and stability.
It reaffirmed that the Islamic Revolution’s fundamental principles — rejecting imperialist powers’ dominance, championing the Palestinian cause, and fostering unity within the Muslim world — remain the essential safeguards for the future of the Iranian nation.

Title: Iran, Saudi Arabia condemn Netanyahu’s remarks on ‘Palestinian state on Saudi territory’ Datetime: 20250210_215900 Content: Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has strongly condemned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s remarks suggesting establishment of a “Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia,” calling them an unprecedented act of aggression that threatens regional peace and security.The top diplomat made the remarks during a telephone conversation with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Monday amid rising tensions over so-called US-Israeli proposals for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the broader affairs that concern them.Araghchi denounced Netanyahu’s statement as a “brazen act of provocation” and warned that such rhetoric exemplified the expansionist ambitions of the Israeli regime.
“These remarks are a clear indication of the unprecedented recklessness of the occupying regime and pose a direct threat to peace and security in the [West Asia] region,” he stated. The official further denounced Israeli officials for seeking to erase the Palestinian identity by means of forced displacement and expansion of the regime’s illegal settlements.Netanyahu came up with the idea after US President Donald Trump said the United States was seeking Gaza’s “ownership” as part of a so-called plan that he wheeled out under the guise of “rebuilding” the war-wrecked Palestinian territory.Also on Monday, Trump insisted that Gaza’s two-million-plus Palestinians had no right to return to the coastal sliver after the “takeover,” claiming they would find “better housing” elsewhere.Araghchi went on to rap the US-Israeli proposals to forcibly push Palestinians out of Gaza, calling it part of a larger colonial scheme to eliminate Palestinian sovereignty.
He urged the international community to take decisive action against, what he regretted was, a systematic attempt to erase the Palestinian cause of liberation from Western-backed deadly Israeli occupation and aggression. Iran has also called for taking place of an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to address the issue.Araghchi, meanwhile, emphasized the necessity of regional and international cooperation to prevent, what he warned was, underway attempts at “normalization” of genocide and lawlessness by the Israeli regime.He called on the Muslim world and the broader international community to adopt immediate measures to ensure accountability for the regime’s atrocities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.During the phone call, bin Farhan conveyed Saudi Arabia’s opposition to forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or other Palestinian territories.
He echoed Araghchi’s concerns about Netanyahu’s remarks, dismissing them as a non-starter and speaking of the kingdom’s support for Palestinian self-determination. Recently, the Popular Resistance Committees, which gathers a number of resistance movements, also issued a strong condemnation in response to Trump’s statements, calling his remarks delusional and rooted in fantasy.The groups rejected Trump's comparing Gaza to a property for sale, describing it as an extension of historical American arrogance towards oppressed nations.“The land of Gaza is soaked with the blood of thousands of martyrs and wounded civilians.It is not for sale, and it will always be a graveyard and a nightmare for occupiers and tyrants,” the statement read.The resistance committees also called Trump’s repeated statements about displacing Palestinians evidence of his ignorance and belief in an illusion of absolute power.
The committees insisted that despite such rhetoric, the Palestinian people remained steadfast in their land, resisting any forced displacement. Gaza-based resistance movement Hamas’ spokesperson Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua has also denounced Trump’s remarks, stating that Gaza was not a real estate commodity, but an integral part of Palestinian land.In an interview with Qatar’s Al Jazeera television network, he emphasized that attempts to eliminate the Palestinian cause would not be accepted.“The occupation seeks to evade its commitments under existing agreements, but we remain committed to resistance,” al-Qanoua asserted, adding that the Israeli regime had failed to uphold the humanitarian aspects of previous accords too.Furthermore, five Arab states, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and Jordan, jointly rejected Trump’s proposal to push Gaza’s population into Egypt and Jordan.
In a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the countries said Gaza’s reconstruction had to involve its own people and that Palestinians should not be forcibly removed from their land. The letter stressed that rebuilding efforts had to take place with active Palestinian participation and international support rather than through displacement.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk

"Within this framework, numerous mega and, of course, infrastructure projects are being defined and implemented." Meanwhile, the Iranian ambassador described the 20-year "historic document" signed by Tehran and Moscow as a "turning point" in relations, noting that it will be a roadmap for strengthening ties in the medium and long term.The Islamic Republic and the Russian Federation are aware of opportunities to further expand their trade, he said, hoping that the implementation of the documents inked in 2024 will boost economic relations in short run.
Close ties between Iran and Russia herald multilateralism on the path towards justice, peace, and security, while the hegemonic system, led by the United States, has put unilateralism at the forefront of its policies, he added. 'Multipolar world order' He said current developments clearly show that the global system has been undergoing a structural transition from a unipolar order to a multipolar one, with emerging powers shaping the new world order.Kazemi further emphasized that Iran has adopted a balanced strategy in its foreign policy, saying the country has an unwavering commitment to the security of all countries in the region and considers foreign interference to be the main source of regional tensions.
Cooperation with independent world powers such as Russia, China and India, as well as interaction with organizations like the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), the group of Developing Eight (D-8) countries, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BRICS group of emerging economies, as well as the Eurasian Economic Union, mark a major step towards securing national interests and security, expanding economic diplomacy, and subsequently redefining Iran's position in a mulitipolar and just world order, he pointed out. Iran and Russia, both subject to illegal Western sanctions, have over the past years deepened their cooperation in a range of areas.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran says Trump’s Gaza plot aimed at ‘erasing Palestine’; Algeria hails Tehran’s OIC proposal Datetime: 20250211_073000 Content: Algeria has welcomed a proposal by Iran to convene a meeting of Islamic countries on the war-torn Gaza Strip, after US President Donald Trump proposed to take over the blockaded Palestinian territory after relocating its entire population.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made the proposal for an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation during a telephone conversation with his Algerian counterpart Ahmed Attaf on Monday evening, as the top Iranian diplomat continues his consultations with foreign ministers of Islamic countries regarding the issue of the Palestinian territory.
He provided a report on his recent consultations with Islamic countries, the OIC secretary general, and the United Nations chief to mobilize the global community against the “ethnic cleansing conspiracy in Gaza.” The Iranian foreign minister also praised Algeria’s “principled stance in supporting the Palestinian people's resistance for self-determination and liberation from the Zionist regime’s occupation." Araghchi described the forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza as part of a colonial plan to “erase Palestine” and strongly condemned it, calling for “a unified and decisive stance on the part of the international community and Islamic countries against this dangerous conspiracy.” The Algerian foreign minister also reaffirmed his country’s firm opposition to the plan to expel Gaza’s residents from their ancestral land.
Last week, Trump said the US was seeking Gaza’s “ownership” as part of a so-called plan that he wheeled out under the guise of “rebuilding” the war-wrecked Palestinian territory, proposing the relocation of some 2.4 million Gazans to Egypt and Jordan. Cairo and Amman have already strongly rejected the highly-provocative plan by Trump, who later proposed the relocation of Palestinians to somewhere within Saudi Arabia.Riyadh also denounced the US president’s proposal.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran files complaint to UN Security Council over Trump's threats: Deputy FM Datetime: 20250211_095300 Content: The deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs says Iran has complained to the United Nations Security Council over US President Donald Trump's threats against the Islamic Republic.Kazem Gharibabadi made the announcement in an X post on Tuesday, three days after Trump warned that he would prefer to make a deal with Iran instead of "bombing the hell out of it...They don’t want to die.Nobody wants to die.” Ghraibabadi said the huge participation of the Iranian people in Monday's march commemorating the 46th anniversary of the victory of the 1979 Islamic Revolution was "a strong response to the US president's recent threats." "Iran will resolutely protect its security and national interests," he added.
Tehran will "legally pursue" Trump's statements that "run counter to the international law and the UN Charter," he said, noting that a letter of protest would be registered as an official UN Security Council document. Trump's warning came a few days after he signed an order seeking to cut Iran's oil exports to zero, while also claiming that he wanted to work towards a nuclear deal.The directive is part of broader sanctions re-imposed after Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018.Also responding to Trump's threat, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that the country “does not seek war… but will not yield to foreign pressure.” He further criticized US president's claim of willingness to hold talks with Iran while simultaneously restoring his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.
“Trump says let’s have a dialogue, and then … he signs and announces all possible conspiracies to bring the [Islamic] Revolution to its knees,” Pezeshkian said. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Tehran, Riyadh expanding, deepening mutual cooperation: Iran’s ambassador Datetime: 20250211_103000 Content: Iran’s ambassador to Riyadh says the Islamic Republic and Saudi Arabia have been expanding and deepening their mutual cooperation since they restored their ties two years ago.Alireza Enayati made the remarks during a ceremony marking the 46th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution in the Saudi capital which was attended by senior Saudi officials and media figures, as well as diplomats and ambassadors.“The two countries are carefully moving ahead through developing, deepening, and consolidating bilateral cooperation, and are proceeding with this path, thanks to the special attention of the two countries’ officials.” Enayati reiterated Iran’s determination to strengthen its cooperation with the neighboring Persian Gulf Arab countries.
After several days of intensive negotiations hosted by China, Iran and Saudi Arabia clinched a deal on March 10, 2023 to restore diplomatic relations after seven years of estrangement. During the ceremony, the Iranian ambassador also referred to Israel’s crimes and condemned the regime’s killing of Palestinians.Enayati urged the world’s countries to support the truce deal reached in Gaza and continue pushing for a full ceasefire, amid fears of the breakdown of the agreement.During the 15 months of the Israeli regime’s genocidal war on Gaza that began in October 2023, at least 48,189 were killed, and 111,640 others were injured, most of them children and women.On January 15, the Israeli regime, having failed to achieve any of its war objectives including the “elimination” of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas or the release of captives, was forced to agree to a ceasefire deal with Hamas.
The agreement has mandated phased release of the Zionist captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. On Monday, US President Donald Trump said if all the Israeli captives held in Gaza were not released by Saturday at noon, he would propose canceling the ceasefire and “let all hell break loose.” His remarks came as Hamas announced that it was suspending the process, citing Israeli violations of the agreement.In response, Tel Aviv also ordered the military to prepare for “any scenario in Gaza.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran’s top general: Regional unity only way to confront ‘terrorist’ Israeli regime Datetime: 20250211_142500 Content: The chief of staff of Iran’s Armed Forces has condemned the US-Israeli plan for the forced displacement of Gazans, saying the only way to confront the Israeli “terrorist” regime is through unity among the countries of the region.Major General Mohammad Baqeri made the remarks during a meeting with Vice Admiral Abdullah Khamis Al Raisi, chief of staff of the Sultanate of Oman’s Armed Forces, at the headquarters of the General Staff of the Armed Forces in Tehran on Tuesday.
“Given the barbaric and expansionist nature of the Zionist regime, the only way to confront this occupying and terrorist regime is through unity and solidarity among the countries of the region.” General Baqeri said the “friendly” relations between Iran and Oman are “historical and developing.” “Our relations with the Sultanate of Oman are strong and stable, but given the existing circumstances, the ties must expand further.” Iran’s top general said the development of maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz and the Sea of Oman is “essential to combat smuggling and ensure maritime security.” The Iranian general invited Oman to participate in the Maritime Security Belt naval drills.
“There is a host of capacities for interaction between the armed forces of the two countries, including in the fields of education, culture, military, and counter-terrorism.” Al Raisi, for his part, said Oman will work to promote regional stability, as the nations of the region are “its rightful owners.” “Unfortunately, however, some trans-regional countries are seeking to sow discord,” he added. Al Raisi said the relations between Oman and Iran have long been based on mutual trust.“Oman has always emphasized the development of ties between the two nations at all levels.” Al Raisi arrived in Tehran on Monday evening at the official invitation of Major General Baqeri.He is scheduled to visit an exhibition showcasing the capabilities of Iran’s Armed Forces and meet with commanders of Iran’s Armed Forces.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran condemns Trump's threat to use force against country Datetime: 20250212_013800 Content: Iran has strongly condemned US President Donald Trump's threat to use force against the country, as deeply alarming and irresponsible.Iran's permanent ambassador to the UN made the remarks in a letter to the UN chief and the president of the Security Council on Tuesday.Amir Saeid Iravani said Trump’s reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international law and the UN Charter.“Upon the instructions from my Government, I am writing to draw the Security Council’s attention to deeply alarming and irresponsible remarks made by the President of the United States, in which he openly threatened the use of force against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Iravani said.Trump said he would prefer to make a deal with Iran rather than “bombing the hell out of it,” in a media interview published on Saturday.“I would like a deal done with Iran on non-nuclear.
I would prefer that to bomb the hell out of it,” Trump told the New York Post. “They don’t want to die.Nobody wants to die.” In yet another belligerent statement, during an interview with Fox News on Monday, Trump reiterated the same language of war.“I would like to make a deal without bombing them.” Iravani said Trump’s “reckless and inflammatory statements flagrantly violate international law and the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4), which prohibits threats or use of force against sovereign states.” The Iranian diplomat also slammed Trump's so-called maximum pressure” policy against Iran as a blatant violation of fundamental principles and norms of international law.“Such provocation is further compounded by the so-called ‘maximum pressure’ policy, outlined in the National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) of 4 February 2025.
This policy reinforces unlawful, unilateral coercive measures and escalates hostility against Iran, blatantly violating fundamental principles and norms of international law,” he stated. Iravani called on the Security Council not to remain silent in the face of such brazen rhetoric and condemned it unequivocally.“The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly rejects and condemns this reckless threat.The UN Security Council must not remain silent in the face of such brazen rhetoric, as normalizing the threat to use force sets a dangerous precedent and must be unequivocally condemned,” he said.He warned that any act of aggression against Iran will have severe consequences, for which the US will bear full responsibility.He emphasized that Iran will resolutely defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against any hostile action.“The Islamic Republic of Iran warns that any act of aggression will have severe consequences, for which the US will bear full responsibility.
As a responsible member of the United Nations, committed to upholding peace, security, and international cooperation, Iran will resolutely defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national interests against any hostile action,” Iravani said. Trump's threats came a few days after he signed an order seeking to cut Iran's oil exports to zero, while also claiming that he wanted to work towards a nuclear deal.The directive is part of broader sanctions re-imposed after Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018.Also responding to Trump's threat, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that the country “does not seek war… but will not yield to foreign pressure.” He further criticized the US president's claim of willingness to hold talks with Iran while simultaneously restoring his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.

Title: Iran, China pursuing 'new era' of strategic interaction within framework of comprehensive partnership: Diplomat Datetime: 20250212_053300 Content: A high-ranking Iranian diplomat has highlighted the deepening strategic partnership between Iran and China, emphasizing the countries’ shared values such as mutual respect, equality, and a commitment to peace.Hossein Darvishi, the Islamic Republic’s Consul General in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, made the remarks on Tuesday, speaking at a ceremony commemorating the 46th anniversary of the victory of the country’s historic Islamic Revolution."In recent years, the two ancient Asian partners have pursued a new era of strategic interactions within the framework of a comprehensive strategic partnership," Darvishi stated."Guided by common values of mutual respect, equality, and peace, this partnership reflects the firm commitment of the Iranian government to foster lasting and all-encompassing cooperation with China,” he stated.
He elaborated on the long-standing relationship between Iran and China, stressing the countries’ historical ties and deep-rooted cultural connections, and emphasizing how these foundations have paved the way for an evolving strategic partnership. The 14th administration of the Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to create a new model of enduring friendship and collaboration [between the nations]," the official said in the same context.Iran and China have significantly strengthened their bilateral relations in recent years, particularly following the signing of a 25-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement in 2021.The encompassing framework provided by the agreement aims to enhance cooperation in economic, technological, and infrastructural development, reflecting both nations' commitment to long-term mutual growth.

Title: Iran diplomatic initiative: OIC set to hold emergency meeting on Trump’s Gaza plot Datetime: 20250212_071200 Content: The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is reportedly to hold an emergency meeting of its foreign ministers in response to an Iranian diplomatic initiative, to address the US's “plans” for forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had engaged in extensive diplomatic outreach over the recent days, holding discussions with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Gambia, which currently holds the OIC’s rotating presidency.In an official letter to the OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, the top diplomat said he had outlined the urgency of convening the meeting to discuss and counter colonial efforts to forcibly relocate the Gaza Strip’s Palestinian population.
Iran's proposal has garnered widespread support from the OIC member states, and the meeting is expected to take place in a few days' time, an IRNA correspondent reported on Wednesday citing an informed source at the Iranian Foreign Ministry. The Islamic Republic’s initiative follows US President Donald Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s either announcing or advocating for forced exodus of Gazans to countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and even Saudi Arabia.Tehran has urged unity among Muslim nations and a collective stance against such measures."The forced displacement ‘plan’ is a continuation of colonial efforts to erase Palestine," Araghchi warned, emphasizing the need for immediate and decisive international action.
He further condemned "a blatant attempt to normalize genocide and lawlessness by the occupying regime." The official also denounced recent statements by the Israeli prime minister, who suggested “establishment of a Palestinian state within Saudi territory.” Araghchi called these remarks "an unprecedented display of aggression by the occupying regime and a serious threat to regional peace and security." Reaffirming the necessity of collective action, he urged the OIC to take significant steps towards confronting the joint US-Israeli scheme. "The international community, particularly regional and Islamic nations, must implement urgent measures to prevent the legitimization of these criminal acts," he stated.Observers say the upcoming OIC meeting will serve as a crucial platform for member states to coordinate their response to the escalating crisis and reinforce their support for Palestinian sovereignty.

Title: Leader: Iranians sent ‘message of unity’ to world on Revolution anniv.amid enemy’s stupid threats Datetime: 20250212_090400 Content: Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has commended the Iranian nation for relaying its “message of unity” to the international community on the 46th anniversary of the country’s historic 1979 Islamic Revolution.Ayatollah Khamenei made the remarks in Tehran on Wednesday, addressing a gathering of Defense Ministry officials, defense industry elites, the ministry’s experts and staff, and families of the martyrs hailing from the country’s defense industry.The Leader described the day marking the Revolution’s victory as one of the most significant national events, showcasing the unity and strength of the Iranian people despite relentless external pressures.Ayatollah Khamenei emphasized that the celebrations on this year’s anniversary were not just a commemoration, but a powerful act of resistance and national unity.
"This was a message of unity from the Iranian people. Despite the constant, idiotic threats against us, the people of Iran showed the world their identity, their strength, and their unwavering resolve.” "This year’s February 22nd was one of the most outstanding celebrations of the Revolution," the Leader stated."It was a popular uprising, a grand national movement.People took to the streets, raised their voices, and shared their views across the media, all over the country.
This was a true popular uprising, a major national movement." Ayatollah Khamenei noted that, "Despite ongoing media bombardments, psychological warfare, and unfounded threats from adversaries against the historic development, the Iranian people stood strong in their commitment to the values of the Revolution with their indication of strong support for the event during this year’s marches and jubilations." Ayatollah Khamenei also made special reference to the presence of young people in the celebrations, their vibrant energy, which was visible across the country’s various cities, not just in Tehran and major urban centers, but in remote towns and villages. Even in cities where the weather was harsh and conditions unfavorable, millions of Iranians participated, demonstrating their collective will, the Leader remarked.
According to observers, Ayatollah Khamenei’s comments reflect the broader sentiment in Iran, where the Revolution’s anniversary has become a symbol of resistance against foreign interference and a reaffirmation of Iran’s sovereignty.

Title: Iran seeks deeper ties with Turkmenistan: President Pezeshkian Datetime: 20250212_154000 Content: Iran has historically sought to expand friendly relations with Turkmenistan and supports the expansion of cooperation across different sectors, says President Masoud Pezeshkian.In a meeting with Turkmenistan's Foreign Minister Avazgeldyevich Meredov in Tehran, the Iranian president said the "necessary orders have been issued to the relevant authorities to examine the areas of further cooperation with the government of Turkmenistan."

Title: Iran condemns litany of hostile US actions, calls out Washington's hypocrisy Datetime: 20250212_211100 Content: The Iranian Foreign Ministry has released a fact sheet featuring the United States long list of historically hostile actions towards the Islamic Republic, denouncing Washington’s hypocritical approach towards the country.The ministry released the fact sheet, which included a whole host of US violations concerning Iran, such as reinstatement of its so-called “maximum pressure” policy towards the Islamic Republic, on Wednesday.The US initiated the policy under Donald Trump’s former tenure as president and relaunched it under his current incumbency, with the American chief executive signing a new “Presidential National Security Memorandum” on February 4, through which he ordered intensification of economic and political pressure against the Islamic Republic.
The ministry described the policy as an extension of Washington’s long-standing adversarial attitude towards Tehran. It, meanwhile, asserted that “maximum pressure” was never truly halted after Trump’s former term wound down, as the previous US administration of Joe Biden not only retained the country’s sanctions against Iran, but also imposed hundreds more.The ministry reiterated the Islamic Republic’s commitment to resisting such coercive measures, emphasizing that no nation should be subjected to illegal and unjust economic pressure.‘Dual approach exposes US hypocrisy’ The US was deploying the policy, while simultaneously calling for negotiations with Iran on the nuclear issue, the ministry said, noting that such attitude contradicted Washington’s rhetoric.Iran underlines that it has always supported diplomacy and engaged in negotiations in good faith.
However, it reminds at the same time that pressure and intimidation tactics have never yielded results as far as dealing with the Islamic Republic is concerned. Iranian authorities, meanwhile, warn that such contradictory approach only deepens distrust and undermines any possibility of meaningful diplomatic engagement.US’s breach of nuclear deal The fact sheet further highlighted the United States track record regarding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement backed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which was signed between Iran and world countries, including the US, in 2015.The former Trump administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 in a unilateral and illegal move, despite its endorsement by the UNSC.It then returned the sanctions that the accord had lifted, and ramped up even more economic pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Washington's departure came despite Iran’s full compliance with the agreement as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the document highlighted. “Over the past four years, despite intensive negotiations to revive the JCPOA, Washington, while expressing a desire to return to the agreement, has never been willing to fulfill its JCPOA commitments or lift sanctions against the Iranian nation, and under various pretexts, it prevented, on different occasions, the negotiations from reaching a final conclusion,” it added.Historical US hostility towards Iran The document also recalled the long history of other aggressive American actions against Iran, dating back to the CIA-orchestrated 1953 coup.It listed numerous examples, including Washington’s military support and other instances of backing for former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980-88 imposed war on Iran, freezing of Iranian assets, and military provocations.
It also reminded the US’s ordering the assassination of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s former top anti-terror commander and a strongly revered national and regional personality, in early 2020, and its facilitating the targeting of Iranian nuclear scientists by the Israeli regime -- which has so far assassinated at least seven of the scientists. Washington’s role in regional instability Additionally, the fact sheet challenged US allegations that Iran supported “terrorism,” asserting that the Islamic Republic was, in fact, the primary victim of terrorism in the region.It pointed to the sacrifices that had been made by Iranian servicemen in the fight against the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in the region and other similar outfits.Meanwhile, the ministry reiterated Iran’s condemnation of the US’s fueling regional instability by backing groups like Daesh, al-Qaeda, and al-Nusra Front, currently Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, to serve its geopolitical interests.
Furthermore, the statement argued that Washington would try to brand Iran’s continued support for regional resistance movements, which fight against deadly Israeli occupation and aggression, as fostering “terrorism” as a pretext to shield the Israeli regime from accountability for its atrocities against the regional peoples, including members of the resistance factions. “Labeling Iran's support for resistance groups and Muslim nations in the region - who are fighting for the liberation of their land and human dignity against an occupying regime - as "support for terrorism" does not change the reality,” it underlined.“Blaming the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a futile US attempt to protect the Zionist regime from accountability and to evade from US responsibility for full-fledged and absolute support for the crimes of this regime,” it added, pointing to Washington’s all-out political, military, and intelligence support for Tel Aviv’s military aggression.
US human rights violations, economic warfare The ministry also condemned Washington’s claims of championing human rights, highlighting its full support for Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip and the devastation that had been caused by economic sanctions on the Iranian people. It reminded that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US even intensified its sanctions, worsening humanitarian conditions in Iran, and asserted that the American policies directly targeted the Iranian people, contradicting Washington’s self-proclaimed concern for human rights.Iran’s response: Diplomacy with strength, dignity Amid the American attitude, Iran’s leadership, guided by the principles of “dignity, wisdom, and expediency,” would refuse to negotiate under pressure, the document underscored.Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has reiterated that engaging in talks under coercion was irrational and would undermine Iran’s sovereignty.
Tehran, however, remains open to diplomacy that safeguards its national interests. While committed to diplomatic solutions, Iran warns that any aggression against its national security would be met with a decisive response, the ministry stressed, pledging to continue pursuing the Islamic Republic’s interests from a position of strength, and ensuring that the country’s sovereignty and regional stability remained non-negotiable.The ministry finally reaffirmed that Iran has never pursued acquiring nuclear weapons, citing a binding religious decree (fatwa) against such prospect that had been issued by the Leader.It called on the US, the only country to have ever deployed nuclear weapons, to refrain from using the nuclear issue as an excuse for confrontation.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran slams US allegations against Tehran concerning Syria, condemns sanctions, Israeli violations Datetime: 20250212_231600 Content: Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations has strongly rejected the US’s accusations against the Islamic Republic of “destabilizing” Syria, calling them “baseless” and a deliberate distortion of reality aimed at misleading the international community.Addressing a UN Security Council session on Syria on Wednesday, Amir Saeid Iravani condemned Washington’s narrative, highlighting its own violations of the Syrian sovereignty under the pretext of counterterrorism.“The accusations made by the US representative against my country are completely unfounded,” he said.
“These claims are crafted solely to distort the truth and mislead the international community.” “The reality is that the United States has long violated Syria’s sovereignty, provided safe havens for terrorist groups, and supported Israel’s aggression—all in pursuit of its geopolitical ambitions.” The envoy was responding to remarks made by Deputy US Ambassador to the world body, Dorothy Shea, who had alleged that Iran “continued to back” militant groups inside Syria and was seeking to “reestablish its military presence” in the war-torn country. Iravani categorically dismissed the claims, emphasizing that Iran remained committed to Syria’s sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity.‘US sanctions hindering Syria’s recovery’ The high-ranking Iranian diplomat, meanwhile, turned the focus towards the humanitarian and economic crisis in Syria, criticizing the “unjust and unlawful” sanctions that had been imposed by the United States and the European Union against the Arab country.
He stressed that such extraterritorial measures were severely hindering Syria’s reconstruction efforts and disproportionately harming ordinary citizens. “Temporary relief or limited humanitarian exemptions are not a sustainable solution,” he said.“These illegal measures must be fully lifted to allow the Syrian people to rebuild their country and return to a life of dignity.” The ambassador also argued that the sanctions directly obstructed early recovery projects necessary for Syria’s long-term stability, adding that their removal was essential for safe and voluntary return of millions of displaced Syrians.On resurgence of terrorism in Syria Iravani further raised the issue of the growing threat of terrorism in Syria.He noted that “foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs)” and extremist groups interfering in the Arab country continued to pose a significant danger to both regional and global security.
“The risk of advanced weapons stockpiles falling into the hands of terrorists is real,” he warned, citing UN reports that an estimated 42,500 individuals with suspected ties to the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group -- which was vanquished by Syria and its allies, including Iran and Russia, in 2017 -- remained in detention camps in northeastern Syria. The official called for a structured and accountable process for repatriating these individuals to their home countries and holding them legally accountable.“Iran remains firmly committed to combating terrorism and is prepared to cooperate with legitimate international partners to address this critical challenge.” Condemnation of Israeli aggression Iravani also lambasted the Israeli regime’s ongoing violations of the Syrian sovereignty, denouncing Tel Aviv for systematically targeting the country’s military and research infrastructure with US backing.
“Israel continues to be a serious threat to Syria, repeatedly violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “Despite numerous Security Council resolutions, the regime refuses to withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights and instead expands its occupation.” Iravani, therefore, urged the Security Council to take decisive action against the Israeli aggression and to hold the regime accountable for its attacks on the Syrian territory.Call for political dialogue, Syrian-led future Reaffirming Iran’s stance on Syria’s future, Iravani stressed that only the Syrian people had to determine their country’s path, free from external interference.He reiterated the Islamic Republic’s support for formation of an inclusive government in Syria based on national dialog and proportional representation, with UN Resolution 2254 -- which called for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria in 2015 -- providing the necessary framework for constitutional reform.
“The future of Syria must be determined solely by its people,” he asserted. “Iran fully supports the formation of a government through free elections, ensuring a fair process that reflects the will of all Syrians.” Iran’s commitment to stability in Syria In conclusion, the Iranian ambassador reaffirmed the country’s role as a constructive partner in efforts to achieve lasting peace in Syria.He expressed full support for the UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen’s efforts and called for a greater international commitment to Syria’s reconstruction and stabilization.Iran remains dedicated to working in coordination with the United Nations and regional partners to achieve lasting peace and stability in Syria, Iravani stated.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Trump talks offer ‘part of maximum pressure’; US commitments ‘unfulfilled’: Leader’s aide Datetime: 20250213_080300 Content: A senior advisor to Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says the US contradictory approach towards Iran is part of Washington’s so-called maximum pressure policy and fails to reflect its genuine readiness to hold talks with Tehran.Ali Shamkhani said the US proposes holding dialogue with Iran but at the same time it intensifies sanctions against the country.Negotiation should be carried out at the proper time from a position of strength and with the aim of securing national interests, not as a solution to internal problems, he added.
He emphasized that negotiations would be meaningful only if both sides demonstrate the necessary will and capacity to reach a lasting agreement, but “experience provers that the US has not remained committed to its obligations.” The senior official once again reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to the talks to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), despite the US’ unilateral withdrawal. Shamkhani said Iran has not abandoned negotiations; rather, it is the United States and Europe that failed to live up to their commitments and must remove the sanctions imposed on the country.He criticized the US policies and its “unreliable” proposal for negotiation, adding that talks hinge on adoption of a logical and respectful approach on the part of the European signatories to the JCPOA.In case of any negotiation, Iran will only focus on the removal of sanctions and not a merely superficial and nonpractical agreement, he pointed out.
The Leader’s aide said any possible agreement or negotiations would not surely lead to the resolution of Iran’s economic problems, further explaining that the experience of the JCPOA and lack of commitment of the US and Europe have shown that relying solely on negotiations would not bear fruit. He stressed that structural reforms and proper economic governance are the main prerequisites for improving the country's situation.Shamkhani dismissed the “incorrect” view that negotiations would lead to an agreement that would solve economic problems.There have been many countries that, despite extensive economic agreements, continue to face economic crises due to weak domestic infrastructure, he explained.He stressed the importance of improving domestic foundations and reducing dependence on external variables to solve the country’s problems.In that case, Iran can enter any possible negotiations from a position of strength and not out of necessity, Shamkhani said.
He was echoing Ayatollah Khamenei’s remarks last week that experience has shown negotiations with the US have no effect on solving Iran's problems. "Some people pretend that if we sit at the negotiating table, some problems will be solved, but the fact that we must understand correctly is that negotiating with the US has no effect on solving the country's problems," the Leader stated.On February 6, the United States imposed its first set of sanctions on Iran after US President Donald Trump revived his so-called maximum pressure strategy against the Islamic Republic.The move came two days after Trump said he was willing to revive negotiations with Iran but signed an executive order, restoring his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Pezeshkian asserts ‘self-reliant’ Iran will resolve problems despite sanctions Datetime: 20250213_105600 Content: Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warns that enemies are desperately seeking to subjugate the Iranian people through sanctions and threats but all in vain."The enemies want us to be humiliated before them with sanctions and threats but we will not be subjugated and we will solve our problems by relying on the people,” Pezeshkian said in a meeting with intellectuals and elites of the southern province of Bushehr on Thursday.He slammed the United States’ contradictory approach to Iran, saying US President Donald Trump claims that he wants to negotiate with Iran but at the same time imposes the toughest sanctions against Tehran.“We do not want anyone to sanction us,” Pezeshkian said, adding, however, “It is not that if the US imposes sanctions on us, we cannot do anything.
We will run the country by reliance on domestic capabilities.” He reiterated Iran’s policy to interact with all countries in a spirit of peace and fraternity, emphasizing, “We strive to establish cordial and friendly relations with our neighbors." Pezeshkian expressed Iran’s keenness to negotiate and criticized Washington’s claims about its willingness to hold talks with Tehran while restricting the access of Iranian people to essentials, including medicine. The president added that solidarity, interaction and planning play a key role in settling domestic problems.On February 6, the United States imposed its first set of sanctions on Iran after Trump revived his so-called maximum pressure strategy against the Islamic Republic.The move came two days after the American president said he was willing to revive negotiations with Iran but signed an executive order, restoring his so-called “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran.

Title: Lebanese protest cancellation of two scheduled civilian flights from Iran to Lebanon Datetime: 20250214_010800 Content: A large number of people have taken to the streets around Beirut’s International Airport to protest the cancellation of two scheduled civilian flights from Iran to Lebanon.On Thursday night, protesters blocked the entrance to the airport and the international road leading to it, setting tires alight while chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans.The demonstrators set fire to tires, creating roadblocks, while tensions rose during clashes with Lebanese military personnel who attempted to clear the route.The cancellation was ordered by the Lebanese Roads Minister under pressure from the Zionist regime, which claimed that the plane was transferring funds to the Hezbollah resistance movement.
Iran’s Mahan Air was reportedly informed that a flight scheduled to arrive in Beirut from Tehran would not receive the necessary permission to land, resulting in the cancellation of the trip. An official at Beirut’s airport toldAFPthat the Public Works and Transport ministry had asked the facility to inform Mahan Air that Lebanon could not welcome two of its Beirut-bound flights.The official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters said one flight was scheduled for Thursday and another for Friday.Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for immediate measures to bring the stranded Lebanese passengers back to Beirut.A pro-resistance lawmaker condemned the decision, stating that the government must take necessary measures to guarantee Lebanon’s sovereignty over all its public facilities, especially the airport.
Ebrahim Mousavi, a member of the Lebanese Parliament, said the Israeli regime's violations of Lebanese sovereignty and the complicity of the international community, especially the United States, have led to the regime's further arrogance. “These actions are strongly condemned, and everyone in Lebanon must loudly denounce them and force the responsible international institutions to take action,” he stated.Mousavi said that the Lebanese people “expect the government to take the necessary measures to establish its sovereignty over all public centers, especially Rafik Hariri International Airport.” “The Zionist enemy must not be allowed to imagine that it can encroach on Lebanese sovereignty at any time,” he stated.
The lawmaker went on to say that the “Lebanese government, with all its institutions, must assume responsibility and pave the way for the rapid return of citizens from Iran, without giving in to Israeli threats.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran's UN mission rejects 'baseless' US claim of arming, funding Yemeni forces Datetime: 20250214_064600 Content: Iran’s Permanent Mission to the UN has categorically dismissed as "baseless" the United States' accusations about the provision of arms and money to the Yemeni resistance forces, saying the Islamic Republic has always supported peace and stability in the Arabian Peninsulacountry.In a letter sent to the UN chief and the president of the Security Council on Thursday, the mission emphasized that Washington cannot hide its complicity in Israel's crimes by pinning the blame on Iran for regional tensions."Unlike the United States that provides weapons and extensive financial support to the Israeli regime to continue its aggression against the oppressed people of the region, the Islamic Republic of Iran has been and will keep adhering to the fundamental principles of the international law, the United Nations Charter, and Security Council resolutions," it added.
Tehran has adopted a "unified and stable" position on the Yemen crisis and believes that the conflict must be resolved via a "comprehensive political process" that guarantees the country's independence, national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. The US, UK, and Israel have launched attacks across Yemen over the past months in violation of the country’s sovereignty and international law.The illegal attacks came in response to Yemen’s campaign to show solidarity with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip amid a genocidal Israeli war.
The Iranian mission said, “Since the beginning of the Yemen crisis, the Islamic Republic of Iran has called for an immediate end to aggression, a ceasefire, the start of meaningful dialogue between Yemeni parties, and the peaceful settlement of the conflict with no foreign interference.” The future of Yemen must be determined by its own people, it noted, stressing that lasting peace is only possible there "through diplomacy, respect for national sovereignty, and adherence to international law, not through military interventions or false accusations.” Speaking at a Security Council briefing on Yemen, US Deputy Representative to the UN Dorothy Shea alleged that Iran's materiel and financial support had enabled Yemen's Ansarullah resistance fighters to launch "numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure" and fire at American warships.
As part of their pro-Palestine campaign, the Yemeni Armed Forces have targeted ships heading to or departing ports in the occupied territories, or those linked to Israel, in the southern Red Sea, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the Gulf of Aden, and even in the Arabian Sea. They have also conducted strikes against Israeli targets in the occupied lands.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas condemns cancellation of allowances to families of martyrs, prisoners Datetime: 20250211_185700 Content: Hamas has condemned a decree issued by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to cut government payments to families of martyrs and prisoners.The PA, which is dominated by the Fatah party, exercises limited powers in parts of the occupied West Bank.On Monday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas issued a decree canceling the allowances paid to the families of prisoners, martyrs, and the wounded as part of the prisoners’ law and the regulations issued by the Council of Ministers and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).The beneficiaries of the PA allowances have included families in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip and Palestinians living in Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere — as well as those considered for release under the phased Gaza war ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.
Hamas condemned Abbas’ decision to cut financial aid to families of prisoners, martyrs and the wounded. “We in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) condemn the decision of President Mahmoud Abbas to cancel the payment of financial allocations to the families of prisoners, martyrs and wounded," Hamas said in a statement.Abbas’ decision to cut financial aid to people and resistance forces who sacrificed for the Palestinian cause is “unpatriotic and departs from one of the national constants,” Hamas added.Hamas insisted that their sacrifices needed to be appreciated, calling for the immediate reinstatement of the allowances.“We need to appreciate the sacrifices of the prisoners and wounded and martyrs’ families and the price they paid in the form of their lives and years in the occupation’s prisons.We must protect their families instead of abandoning them at this fateful moment in the history of our Palestinian cause,” it said.
“We call for an immediate reversal of it, and not to submit to the pressures of the Zionist occupation and the American administration,” it added. Prior to this, Abbas had condemned the Israeli regime’s genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.He described the Israeli aggression and constant bombardment of Gaza as a "barbaric war" and "genocide".“We are facing together a barbaric war of aggression and an open war of genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank,” Abbas stated in a speech in Ramallah.He described Israeli regime forces' brutal slaughter of Palestinians as "a war against the existence of the Palestinians, against the Palestinian national identity, the identity of the land and the identity of its inhabitants.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Jordan's king rejects Trump plan to relocate Palestinians Datetime: 20250211_214200 Content: Jordan's King Abdullah II has told Donald Trump that Arab nations are united in opposition to the US president's plan to take over Gaza and relocate Palestinians."I reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank," Abdullah said on social media on Tuesday after talks in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC "This is the unified Arab position," he stated.However, Abdullah told Trump that his country would take in some 2,000 sick Palestinian children."One of the things that we can do right away is take 2,000 children, cancer children who are in a very ill state.That is possible," Abdullah said as Trump welcomed him in the Oval Office.Trump replied that it was "really a beautiful gesture" and claimed he didn't know about it before the Jordanian king arrived at the White House.
In addition, he also told Trump that Egypt was working on a plan for how countries in the region could "work" with the US president on the proposal. Ahead of his tense meeting with Trump at the White House in Washington, King Abdullah called for the establishment of a Palestinian state.The king was the first Arab leader to meet with Trump since he assumed office last month.The meeting came amid uproar caused by Trump’s call to take over the besieged Gaza Strip and relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries.Trump has repeatedly stated that Jordan and Egypt will take in Palestinians from the blockaded Palestinian region, an idea that Amman and Cairo have flatly rejected.The US president has suggested that he could deny aid to Jordan and Egypt if they didn't accept his proposal.“If they don’t agree, I would conceivably withhold aid.” Jordan receives $1.45 billion a year in US aid.Jordanian officials have said the Arab country is prepared to go without it.
"American aid is important and necessary for the budget, constituting 10 percent of the state's budget, but if it is linked to the issue of relocation, we will not hesitate to forgo it," a Jordanian official was quoted as saying. King Abdullah has rejected any attempts to annex land and displace Palestinians after a shock proposal by Trump that the US take over Gaza.The US leader stunned the world when he announced a proposal last week for the United States to "take over" Gaza, envisioning rebuilding the devastated territory into the "Riviera of the Middle East" -- but only after resettling Palestinians elsewhere.On Tuesday, Abdullah urged patience and said that Egypt was coming up with a response and that Arab nations would then discuss it at talks in Riyadh."Let's wait until the Egyptians can come and present it to the president and not get ahead of ourselves," Abdullah said.On Friday, thousands of Jordanians took to the streets in Amman to protest against Trump's plan.
Last week, well-placed sources in Amman said Jordan was ready to declare war on Israel if Palestinians were forcibly expelled into its territory. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi confirmed that view two days later.The Jordanian monarch met with US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz late Monday.He underlined the necessity of “achieving just and comprehensive peace based on a two-state solution.” Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and members of his ruling coalition have openly announced their opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians came as a ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since January 19.His proposal was met with wide condemnations from the Palestinians, Arab countries and many other nations across the world, including Canada, France, Germany and Britain.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Gaza hospital chief Abu Safiya subjected to ‘severe torture’ in Israeli prison, says family Datetime: 20250212_060100 Content: The family of Dr.Hussam Abu Safia, director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, says he has been subjected to “severe torture and mistreatment” following his arrest by Israeli forces in late December.Abu Safiya’s family, citing his lawyer, said in a post on X on Wednesday that he endured harsh conditions in the first days of his detention in Israeli jails and was held in solitary confinement for 24 days before being transferred to Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, where he continues to face poor treatment.Good evening to everyone,By the grace of God, we were informed of the details and report of the visit.My father was subjected to severe mistreatment and torture by the army in the early days of his arrest and was held in solitary confinement for 24 days.
After that, he was… According to Abu Safiya's family, he suffers from chronic high blood pressure and an enlarged heart muscle. His family added that although Abu Safiya is currently receiving treatment, he is only given one meal per day which is "inadequate” and of very poor quality.“Regarding his legal case, it is clean, and there are no charges against him,” his family said, adding that all accusations attributed to him have been denied due to lack of evidence and the case is clear.His family noted that Abu Safiya’s release could be imminent in the coming stages of the prisoner exchange, as the Israeli prosecutors have not filed any charges.Abu Safiya’s family further called on the international community to pressure Israel to provide adequate food and medicine for him and secure his immediate release.In late December, Israeli forces raided Kamal Adwan Hospital, forcing patients and medical staff to leave while detaining the rest.Dr.
Abu Safiya, 51, was among those taken for questioning by the Israeli military over alleged links to the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas. He has already called for international intervention to secure his release and that of all detained medical personnel, stressing that healthcare workers must be protected, their rights upheld, and their immediate release ensured.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran diplomatic initiative: OIC set to hold emergency meeting on Trump’s Gaza plot Datetime: 20250212_071200 Content: The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is reportedly to hold an emergency meeting of its foreign ministers in response to an Iranian diplomatic initiative, to address the US's “plans” for forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had engaged in extensive diplomatic outreach over the recent days, holding discussions with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Malaysia, and Gambia, which currently holds the OIC’s rotating presidency.In an official letter to the OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, the top diplomat said he had outlined the urgency of convening the meeting to discuss and counter colonial efforts to forcibly relocate the Gaza Strip’s Palestinian population.
Iran's proposal has garnered widespread support from the OIC member states, and the meeting is expected to take place in a few days' time, an IRNA correspondent reported on Wednesday citing an informed source at the Iranian Foreign Ministry. The Islamic Republic’s initiative follows US President Donald Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s either announcing or advocating for forced exodus of Gazans to countries such as Egypt, Jordan, and even Saudi Arabia.Tehran has urged unity among Muslim nations and a collective stance against such measures."The forced displacement ‘plan’ is a continuation of colonial efforts to erase Palestine," Araghchi warned, emphasizing the need for immediate and decisive international action.
He further condemned "a blatant attempt to normalize genocide and lawlessness by the occupying regime." The official also denounced recent statements by the Israeli prime minister, who suggested “establishment of a Palestinian state within Saudi territory.” Araghchi called these remarks "an unprecedented display of aggression by the occupying regime and a serious threat to regional peace and security." Reaffirming the necessity of collective action, he urged the OIC to take significant steps towards confronting the joint US-Israeli scheme. "The international community, particularly regional and Islamic nations, must implement urgent measures to prevent the legitimization of these criminal acts," he stated.Observers say the upcoming OIC meeting will serve as a crucial platform for member states to coordinate their response to the escalating crisis and reinforce their support for Palestinian sovereignty.

Title: Three million Israelis suffering from trauma since October 7 op, subsequent Gaza genocide Datetime: 20250212_072600 Content: A new report has revealed that approximately three million Israeli settlers had experienced anxiety, depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of Operation al-Aqsa Flood by Palestinian resistance groups on October 7, 2023, and subsequent genocidal war on Gaza.The report, compiled by Israeli comptroller Matanyahu Engelman and released on Tuesday, stated that the Israeli mental health system, which had difficulty functioning even before the historic event, collapsed in the first days of the Hamas-led operation.It noted that in the six months following the surprise and large-scale attack, only about 0.6 percent of the population received mental health treatment through health management organizations (HMOs) and resilience centers, even though 38% of the population reported moderate to severe symptoms.
“I warned about the failures in the field of mental health care in a letter to the prime minister about a month after the operation,” Engelman wrote, “but all the deficiencies have yet to be fully corrected.” According to the findings of the report, an estimated 580,000 Israeli settlers suffer from at least one symptom of PTSD at a severe level as a direct consequence of the incidents of October 7 and their aftermath. Engelman said he presented his first findings to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on November 13, 2023, after visiting conflict zones in the southern and northern flanks of the occupied lands.He took a swipe at Israeli Health Minister Uriel Buso and ministry Director-General Moshe Bar Siman-Tov for not updating the mental health system’s preparations, despite an emergency management authority assessment that was first published in 2001.
Of the comptroller’s sample of 1,010 adults, one-third of the participants reported moderate or severe post-traumatic stress disorder or depression symptoms. About one-fifth reported anxiety symptoms.The survey predicts that approximately 900,000 people will seek help for mental health issues in the future.Broken healthcare system Engelman noted that because of a shortage of manpower, the treatment offered by the HMOs and resilience centers is not sufficient to meet demand.Backed by the United States and its Western allies, Israel launched the war on Gaza, after Hamas and other Gaza-based Palestinian resistance movements carried out Operation Al-Aqsa Flood against the Israeli regime in response to its decades-long campaign of oppression against Palestinians.Israel's genocidal war on Gaza has led to the death of at least 48,219 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injury of 111,665 others since early October 2023.
A ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement went into effect in Gaza on January 19, halting Israel's aggressive campaign against the coastal region. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: MSF reports deterioration of healthcare in occupied West Bank Datetime: 20250212_075800 Content: A recently released report byDoctors Without Borders (MSF)highlights the deterioration of healthcare services in the occupied West Bank since Israel's military actions in Gaza in October 2023.The report points to continuous Israeli military incursions, restrictions on movement, and, direct attacks on medical facilities and personnel, as primary reasons for the worsening crisis.Nearly half of essential medicines are unavailable, with hospitals struggling to operate as health care workers have gone unpaid for about a year.This report highlights how Israeli military raids and settler violence severely restrict Palestinian access to health care.It describes these attacks as the systematic repression, echoing the International Court of Justice's designation of Israeli policies as apartheid.
The report warns that these restrictions are part of Israel's collective punishment against Palestinians. Jenan Sa’ad, Media Officer, MSF Beirut In the West Bank, options are limited as the situation remains volatile due to Israeli escalation and deadly crackdowns.We've documented severe obstacles, from ambulance interceptions to military raids trapping patients in their homes.Curfews and hospital blockades prevent care while medical staff face threats.To respond, we're decentralizing healthcare with mobile clinics, mental health support and strengthened first responders, Jenan Sa’ad, Media Officer, MSF Beirut While Palestinians suffer on many fronts, the healthcare system is now among the biggest battles for survival.The Palestinian healthcare system was already struggling, but Israeli attacks and restrictions have worsened the crisis.Medical teams face assaults.Hospitals are besieged and patients are denied care.
Israel ignores international law and global silence enables its violations aiming to make life unlivable for Palestinians. Mustafa Shabaan, Palestinian Health Ministry The report by MSF adds to mounting concerns over Israeli policies in the occupied territories, which the International Court of Justice has already described as constitutive for an apartheid system.As Palestinian hospitals struggle to function under immense pressure, the future of health care in the West Bank remains uncertain.With resources running out and medical staff working without pay, Doctors Without Borders warns that the situation could spiral into a full-blown humanitarian disaster if urgent international action is not taking to deal with this crisis.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel kills Palestinian youth in West Bank raids, expands settlements amid escalation Datetime: 20250212_104100 Content: Israeli military forces have shot dead a young Palestinian man in the southern part of the West Bank, as the regime forces continue to expand their deadly assaults across the occupied territory.The official Palestinian news agency WAFA, citing medical sources at Al-Ahli Hospital in the city of al-Khalil, reported that 19-year-old Abdullah Murad Farroukh succumbed to critical injuries after being shot by Israeli forces during a raid on Sa'ir town, located 8 kilometers (4.9 miles) northeast of al-Khalil, on Tuesday evening.Additionally, a 22-year-old man and a 10-year-old girl sustained gunshot wounds during confrontations that broke out following the Israeli military’s attack on the town.Following the extrajudicial killing of Farroukh, Israeli forces stormed his family home, further traumatizing his loved ones in a cruel act of collective punishment.
In related developments, Israeli forces detained two women from their homes in the city of Tulkarm, and made “large-scale” arrests in the Arroub refugee camp, near al-Khalil. WAFA news agency, citing local sources, reported that four people were arrested in the town of Abwein, while one was detained in the village of al-Mazraa al-Gharbiya, northwest of Ramallah.Israeli troops also rounded up a Palestinian man in the village of Burqa, two brothers in the town of Beita, south of Nablus, and two more people in the eastern area of Nablus as well as the town of Beit Fajjar.The Israeli military launched a large-scale offensive in the occupied West Bank on January 21, just two days after a Gaza ceasefire deal between the Tel Aviv regime and Hamas came into effect.The onslaught has resulted in the displacement of more than 35,000 Palestinians from the Jenin, Tulkarm and Far’a refugee camps.
According to the United Nations, some 90 percent of the residents of the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps have been forced to flee. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says displacement and destruction in the Jenin camp have turned the area into a “ghost town,” while the UN human rights office says the killings and the demolition of homes “indicate ongoing violations of international law.” Israel builds new illegal settlement in West Bank amid escalation Meanwhile, Israeli authorities have started construction of a new settlement in the West Bank amid military escalation in the occupied territory.Moayad Shaaban, who heads the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, said the illegal Nahal Hilts settlement is being built on Palestinian land in the village of Battir, located 6.4 kilometers (3.9 miles) west of Bethlehem.“Israel approved the construction of the new settlement in response to global recognition of the Palestinian state last year,” he added in a statement.
Over 770,000 Israelis live in settlements built since the 1967 Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East al-Quds, according to the latest figures released by the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, a Palestinian Authority agency. While all Israeli settlements are illegal under international law, the Tel Aviv regime keeps expanding them in blatant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel killed 360,000 Palestinians in Gaza; real toll 'severely under-reported’: Renowned American attorney Datetime: 20250212_104800 Content: A renowned American attorney and indigenous rights campaigner estimates that the Israeli military has killed at least 360,000 people in its 15-month-long genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, arguing that the besieged territory’s true death toll is significantly higher than the figure reported by mainstream media.Steven Donziger, who spent decades battling Chevron over pollution in the Ecuadorian rainforest, made the assertion on Wednesday, as he criticized the “narrow and incomplete” death count in Gaza, which “is severely under-reported” in international news outlets.“Official data from the Gaza Ministry of Health reports approximately 46,000 deaths, but this figure only includes direct fatalities from bombings and missile strikes.
It does not take into account the widespread indirect deaths from starvation, disease, and lack of medical care caused by the destruction of Gaza’s health infrastructure and the blockade imposed by Israel,” he said. He went on to say that as of January 19, 2024, the number of deaths in Gaza, including both direct and indirect causes, could be as high as 306,000, according to his analysis.The Harvard-trained lawyer further compared this figure to the population of the United States, stating that if the same proportion of Americans had died in a conflict, it would be equivalent to 46 million people, or about 14% of the country’s population.
While acknowledging that these estimates are not precise, he maintained that they reflect the scale of the human tragedy in Gaza, saying, “I have a great deal of confidence that our calculation accurately captures the shocking scale of what has happened—and continues to happen.” Donziger’s figures are based on a study published by the UK’sLancetmedical journal in June 2023 estimating that the accumulative effects of Israel’s war on Gaza could mean the true death toll could reach more than 186,000 people. From this, Donziger calculated that with an additional 214 days of fighting until the ceasefire in January 2024, the total death toll would have risen to approximately 306,000.Also in January this year,The Lancetpublished a study estimating that Gaza's death toll during the first nine months of the war was about 40 percent higher than figures reported by the Palestinian Health Ministry.
The study suggested the total death toll was actually at around 64,260, which would mean the health ministry had under-reported the number of deaths by 41 percent. The new study used data from the ministry, an online survey and social media obituaries to estimate that there were between 55,298 and 78,525 deaths from traumatic injuries in Gaza by that time.Earlier, a UN report had indicated that around 10,000 missing Gazans are probably buried under rubble.The number of dead in Gaza has been a matter of bitter debate since Israel launched its genocidal campaign against the blockaded territory on October 7, 2023, after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out a historic operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: South Africa won't withdraw genocide case against Israel after Trump threatens to cut off aid Datetime: 20250212_152300 Content: South Africa says it will not withdraw its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) despite US President Donald Trump’s order to freeze Washington’s aid to the country.Trump signed an executive order Friday aimed at freezing "foreign aid or assistance” to South Africa in retaliation for the ICJ case and a new land expropriation law it claims is designed to seize property from the country’s Afrikaner minority.The US president claimed that Pretoria had taken an aggressive stance against the United States and its allies through its position on Israel.South Africa’s Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said Wednesday that there is “no chance” of Pretoria withdrawing the case it filed against the Israeli regime in December 2023.
“Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world, and the rule of law.” South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court in December 2023. It said Tel Aviv was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and called for the court to order a halt to Israel’s genocidal campaign in the Strip.While a final ruling is pending, the court ruled last year that “there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and the continuing serious harm to civilians since then.” Many countries have followed suit and supported South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, whose 15 months of brutal campaign of death and destruction claimed the lives of more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza and left the besieged coastal enclave in ruins.The war came to a halt after Hamas and Israel reached a ceasefire agreement on January 19.
Still, Trump threatened on Monday that he will call for cancellation of the ceasefire and “let all hell break out,” if Hamas does not release all of the captives by noon on February 15. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel orders forced displacement of Palestinians in Nur Shams refugee camp Datetime: 20250212_153600 Content: Israel has ordered the immediate evacuation of Palestinian residents from the Nur Shams refugee camp in the northern part of the occupied West Bank as the regime escalates its military offensive.The military raids in the city of Tulkarm and its camps, including Nur Shams, have entered the 17th consecutive day.The Nur Shams refugee camp had been under Israeli siege for at least four days.On Wednesday, the Israeli regime ordered the evacuation of the residents.Eyewitnesses reported that “occupation forces stormed a mosque in the camp and used loudspeakers to call on residents to leave, as the camp has been under attack for the past four days.” Israeli forces deployed foot soldiers, military vehicles, and sound bombs at the camp’s alleyways and entrances.They repeatedly fired live bullets and sound bombs to create fear and panic among the refugees.
The refugees described the situation as “extremely difficult, with homes and shops destroyed, streets leveled, and soldiers brutally raiding homes, and breaking furniture.” Israeli forces “assaulted young men, expelled the elderly without letting them take basic items like clothing, and confiscated mobile phones,” the refugees said. According to the Media Office of the Nur Shams Camp Services Committee, “thousands of displaced people, including women, children, the elderly, and the sick, have fled the camp.” The Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank are marked by widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and property, arrests, and forced displacement of thousands of refugees.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday that the operations in the occupied West Bank have led to the forced displacement of at least 40,000 refugees from the Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur Shams, and Al-Far’a camps.
Since January 15, when the Israeli regime reached a ceasefire agreement with Palestinian resistance groups, it has increased its heinous actions in the occupied West Bank, including destroying civilian infrastructure, houses and refugee camps.

Title: Senior Arab officials warn Trump's Gaza scheme could inflame West Asia Datetime: 20250212_172100 Content: Senior Arab officials have warned that US President Donald Trump’s vicious scheme to take over the Gaza Strip and resettle Palestinians will fuel regional instability.Addressing the World Government Summit in Dubai on Wednesday, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said if Trump pressed ahead with his plan, he would lead West Asia into a new cycle of crises with a “damaging effect on peace and stability.” Jasem al-Budaiwi, who heads the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council political and economic alliance, called on Trump to remember the strong ties between the region and Washington.
“But there has to be give and take, he says his opinion and Arab world should say theirs; what he is saying won’t be accepted by the Arab world." The Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have already condemned in the strongest terms Trump’s remarks on the “takeover” of Gaza. Meanwhile, two Egyptian security sources said President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will not travel to Washington for talks at the White House if the agenda includes Trump’s plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza.Sisi has repeatedly said Egypt would never participate in a large displacement of Palestinians across the border.In a call between Trump and Sisi on February 1, the US president extended an open invitation to Sisi to visit the White House.No date has been set for any such visit, a US official said.Trump enraged the Muslim world and beyond by declaring unexpectedly that the United States would take over Gaza and resettle its over two million population in neighboring countries.
Trump has said the Palestinians in Gaza could settle in countries like Jordan, and Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state. Both have rejected the proposal.Egypt will host an emergency Arab summit on February 27 to discuss “serious” developments for Palestinians.Trump’s plan has upended decades of US policy that endorsed a two-state solution.The US president has said the Palestinians would have no right to return.Palestinians fear a repeat of the “Nakba,” or catastrophe, when nearly 800,000 people were forced out of their homeland during the 1948 war that led to the illegal creation of Israel.On Tuesday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian resistance group did not release captives by midday February 15.Hamas later issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardizing it.
Hamas has gradually been releasing captives since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19. But Hamas said on Monday it would not free any more captives over accusations that Israel was violating the deal.“If the situation explodes militarily once more, all this (ceasefire) effort will be wasted,” Aboul Gheit said.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: CPJ: Israel responsible for 2024 being deadliest year in history for journalists Datetime: 20250212_173600 Content: The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said that 2024 was the deadliest year in recorded history for journalists with 124 deaths, and the Israeli regime is responsible for 70 percent of the total.CPJ said on Wednesday that 2024 was the deadliest year since the organization started keeping records with 124 journalists killed across the globe.The global increase in killings (a 22 percent increase from 2023) was largely because of the Israeli regime’s genocidal war in Gaza, CPJ said.At least 85 journalists were killed during the 15-month war in Gaza, all at the hands of the Israeli regime’s forces, CPJ said.82 of the killed journalists during this period were Palestinian.“Today is the most dangerous time to be a journalist in CPJ’s history,” said CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg.
“The war in Gaza is unprecedented in its impact on journalists and demonstrates a major deterioration in global norms on protecting journalists in conflict zones,” she added. “In Gaza and Lebanon, CPJ documented … cases where journalists were murdered by the Israeli military, in defiance of international laws that define journalists as civilians during conflict,” she said.“Thirty-one of freelancers were killed in Gaza.Many Gaza journalists became freelancers after their outlets were destroyed … their coverage proving crucial for global media outlets because Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering the Strip,” she stated.CPJ is also investigating 20 further killings in which it believes the Israeli regime may have specifically targeted journalists."We know in most of these cases that Israel knew these individuals were journalists and killed them anyway, which is if that is the case, a war crime," Ginsberg said.
"In some cases, we know it because Israel told us that they killed those individuals." The Gaza Government Media Office puts the number of journalists being killed by the Israeli regime far above the CPJ statistics. According to the Gaza Government Media Office, the Israeli regime has killed at least 205 journalists in Gaza alone since October 7, 2023.A ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement went into effect in Gaza on January 19, halting Israel's campaign of genocide in the Palestinian territory.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Islamic Jihad warns fate of Israeli captives depends on Netanyahu's actions Datetime: 20250212_181500 Content: The Palestinian Islamic Jihad warns Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel is responsible for the fate of captives held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad movement, said in a Wednesday statement that Palestinian resistance has fulfilled its duties and commitments in the ceasefire agreement, “while the enemy has left its captives in danger and an uncertain fate.” “The fate of the prisoners held by the resistance is directly tied to Netanyahu's actions, for better or worse.” It said that the resistance “will adhere to the ceasefire agreement in all its details as long as the enemy remains committed to it.” Al-Quds Brigades issued the warning after Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, threatened on Tuesday to withdraw from the ceasefire deal with Hamas and resume “intense fighting” in the Gaza Strip if Hamas does not release more captives by midday February 15. Under the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19, the resistance is scheduled to release three Israeli captives each Saturday.
Israel’s minister of military affairs Israel Katzalso threatened on Wednesday that if Hamas does not release Israeli captives by Saturday, "the gates of hell will open on them [Gazans], just as the US president promised.” Katz was referring to Donald Trump’s recent threat that he will call for cancellation of the ceasefire and “let all hell break out,” if Hamas does not release all of the captives by noon on February 15. The Israel minister claimed that the new war on Gaza will be "different in intensity" and "will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages." Hamas won’t accept ‘language of threats’ In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said Wednesday that the resistance group’s “position is clear.” He said Hamas “will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats.” Qassem reiterated that “Israel must commit to implementing the terms of the ceasefire agreement for the release” of the captives.
During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, 33 Israeli captives are to be released in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian abductees. Hamas warned earlier this week that it could delay the release of Israeli captives, since the regime’s military has violated the ceasefire deal, by carrying out deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and inhibiting Palestinians' passage to northern Gaza.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas rejects US-Israeli 'threats' on captive exchange Datetime: 20250212_182900 Content: The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says it will not bow down to threats from Israel and the United States on the issue of captives.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said on Wednesday that Israel was "evading the implementation of several provisions of the ceasefire agreement," warning that captives would not be released without Israel complying with the deal."Our position is clear, and we will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats," said Qassem, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to "resume intense fighting" if captives were not released by Saturday.On Wednesday, the regime’s military affairs minister warned Israel will restart its war on Gaza if Hamas fails to release Israeli captives and that this time it will be more devastating.
“The new Gaza war will be different in intensity from the one before the ceasefire, and it will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages,” Israeli Katz said in a statement. “It will also allow the realization of US President [Donald] Trump’s vision for Gaza,” Katz said, referring to the American leader’s plan for the United States to take over the Palestinian territory.Those threats echoed Trump, who said on Monday that "hell" would break loose if Hamas failed to release "all" Israeli captives by then.Hamas negotiators in Egypt Hamas earlier said in a statement that a delegation headed by its top negotiator and Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya "arrived in Cairo and began meetings with Egyptian officials" and was monitoring "the implementation of the ceasefire agreement." A diplomat familiar with the talks told AFP that mediators from Qatar and Egypt were engaged with both Israel and Hamas to resolve the dispute and ensure the implementation of the agreement.
The truce has largely halted more than 15 months of genocide and seen Israeli captives released in batches in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. But the deal has come under increasing strain with Hamas accusing Israel of failing to meet its commitments under the agreement, including on aid, and citing the deaths of three Gazans at the weekend in fresh attacks.Hamas has said it would postpone the next captive exchange scheduled for Saturday, citing Israeli violations.Israel and Hamas have so far carried out five rounds of captive exchange under the first phase, which was to last for 42 days.The regime and Hamas have yet to agree on the next phases of the truce.UN chief Antonio Guterres has urged Hamas to proceed with the planned release and "avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza."

Title: Egypt, Jordan urge ‘unity’ on Gaza, rebuilding without relocation Datetime: 20250212_192300 Content: Egypt and Jordan have underscored ‘unity’ on the issue of the Gaza Strip, calling for rebuilding the Palestinian territory without relocating Gazans.US President Donald Trump has proposed to relocate Gaza's entire population before taking over the territory.In a statement on Wednesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II emphasized the “unity” of Cairo and Amman on their position on the fate of Gaza, just a day after the Jordanian leader and Trump held talks in Washington.“The two leaders affirmed the unity of the Egyptian and Jordanian positions,” on the reconstruction of the war-torn territory, “without displacing the Palestinian people from their land,” read a statement from the Egyptian presidency.
Separately, the Jordanian royal court said in a statement that Sisi and King Abdullah stressed their “shared position” in rejecting the forced displacement of Gazans. According to both statements, the two leaders also referred to their willingness to “cooperate” with the US president to achieve “just and lasting peace” in West Asia.Last week, Trump said the US was seeking Gaza’s “ownership” as part of a plan that he wheeled out under the guise of “rebuilding” the war-wrecked Palestinian territory, proposing the relocation of some 2.4 million Gazans to Egypt and Jordan.Cairo and Amman had earlier strongly rejected the highly provocative plan by Trump, who has threatened he might halt aid to both nations if they refuse to take in Palestinian refugees.
“This is the unified Arab position,” King Abdullah wrote on social media following his meeting with Trump on Tuesday, stressing that Jordan remains “steadfast” in its position against the forced relocation of Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Egypt will host an Arab summit this month, presenting a “comprehensive vision” for Gaza’s reconstruction while ensuring Palestinians stay on their land.Egypt and Jordan, key US allies, depend heavily on foreign aid, with the US among their top donors.Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians came as a ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since January 19.His proposal was met with condemnations from the Palestinians, Arab countries, and many other nations across the world, including US allies Canada, France, Germany, and Britain.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel mounts West Bank raids; 44,000 Palestinians displaced in military offensive since Jan.21 Datetime: 20250213_071000 Content: The Israeli military has conducted more raids in several cities and refugee camps across the occupied West Bank, firing indiscriminately at Palestinians and violently forcing them out of their homes.Reports said the Israeli attacks took place at the Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur Shams, Askar, and Balata refugee camps, all situated in the northern West Bank, sparking clashes with local Palestinians.Other raids, the reports added, targeted the Shu’fat, Aida, and al-Arroub camps, near the cities of al-Quds, Bethlehem and al-Khalil, respectively.Meanwhile, Israeli forces stormed the city of Nablus as well as the towns of Yatta and Attil.In the Nur Shams camp, the occupation troops demolished and ransacked Palestinian houses, and ordered residents to evacuate.
The head of the Popular Committee for Services in Nur Shams, Nihad al-Shawish, said the situation inside the camp is extremely dire amid the ongoing Israeli assault. Israeli soldiers are firing at everything that moves inside the camp, he noted.Many families remain trapped in their homes, facing imminent danger, while essential services such as water and electricity have been cut off.Shawish also said the Israeli military is brutally mistreating residents, storming their homes by force, firing live bullets and stun grenades, and threatening them to leave in an apparent effort to empty the camp of its residents.The Israeli military launched its offensive against the occupied West Bank on January 21, claiming that it was targeting resistance fighters of the Jenin Battalion.Israel has ramped up West Bank violence since October 7, 2023, when it launched its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.Since then, the regime forces have killed at least 910 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli army continued for the 22nd day its attacks on the Jenin refugee camp. More than 20,000 people were evicted by force from their homes.The army caused huge damage to people’s homes and the infrastructure of the camp.pic.twitter.com/ImUWpuV3KZ '44,000 Palestinians displaced in northern West Bank' The Israeli invasion has displaced 44,000 Palestinians in the northern West Bank since January 21, according to the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).“What we are witnessing in the West Bank is the worst situation since the second Intifada...The patterns of attacks and methods used are also similar to those seen during Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza,” Diana Alzeer, FIDH’s vice president, said, calling for “serious” global pressure on Israeli authorities to end their deadly attacks in the West Bank.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas calls for 'solidarity marches' worldwide against US-Israel 'ethnic cleansing' Datetime: 20250213_082600 Content: The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has called for worldwide protests and “solidarity marches” over the weekend for unified international response to the US-Israeli plan of “ethnic cleansing” in Palestine.Hamas in a statement on Wednesday called people around the globe to participate in mass demonstrations in capital cities, and let the coming Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays be a global movement against the regime's genocide of the oppressed people of Gaza.“We ...call on the masses of our people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world to go out in massive solidarity marches” from Friday through Sunday to denounce “the plans to displace our Palestinian people from their land,” Hamas said in the statement.
The movement said that the demonstrations are a show of support for the Palestinian people's inalienable right to defend their territory, and their right to freedom, independence, and self-determination. Hamas also expressed gratitude for the worldwide support and solidarity in favor of the people of Gaza during the 15 months of Israel’s genocide.The statement came on the day Israel threatened to launch a “new” war on Hamas and implement US President Donald Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip if Hamas does not release all the Israeli captives by Saturday.The remarks by the regime’s military affairs minister Israel Katz came shortly after Hamas said it would not bow down to US and Israeli “threats” over the release of captives under a fragile truce deal.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said that Israel was "evading the implementation of several provisions of the ceasefire agreement," warning that captives would not be released without Israel complying with the deal.
Meanwhile, Hamas said in a statement that a delegation headed by its top negotiator and Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya had "arrived in Cairo and began meetings with Egyptian officials" and was monitoring "the implementation of the ceasefire agreement." The ceasefire was initiated last month between the Israeli regime and Hamas in the hope of ending a ferocious war of genocide by the regime that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Ever since the ceasefire took effect on January 19, the regime’s military has violated the ceasefire deal, by carrying out deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and medical supplies and inhibiting Palestinians' passage to northern Gaza.Furthermore, the Israeli regime has significantly intensified its attacks on West Bank residents, killing more than 900 Palestinians, with United Nations reports indicating that 44,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced from their homes in the region.

Title: Israel still restricting vital aid to Gaza Strip as 801 trucks enter: UN Datetime: 20250213_083800 Content: Israel is still severely restricting the amount of essential humanitarian aid deliveries to the blockaded Gaza Strip, aid organizations warn, in violation of a ceasefire in place between Tel Aviv and the Palestinian Hamas resistance movement.In a statement on Wednesday, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 801 aid trucks had entered the Palestinian territory earlier in the day “through interactions with the Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire deal.” Nevertheless, it warned that access to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory is still tightly limited, with severe restrictions on vital items such as fuel and medical equipment.
The UN agency added that the world body and its partners, however, spare no effort to seize any opportunity provided by the shaky truce “to scale up the provision of water, food, shelter, health, sanitation, hygiene, clothing, education and other assistance to the people of Gaza.” OCHA also noted that the Israeli army's acts of aggression in northern areas of the occupied West Bank “continue to cause civilian casualties and displacement, as well as damage to infrastructure.” Separately, UNRWA, the UN refugee agency that works primarily with the Palestinians being oppressed by the Israeli regime, said that it successfully delivered food to 1.2 million people in Gaza during the first two weeks of the ceasefire. “As of last week, UNRWA was hosting about 120,000 people in 120 shelters, including more than three dozen that opened since the ceasefire,” it added.
Furthermore, it managed to establish 37 new shelters in northern Gaza, providing displaced families with essential supplies, including tents, blankets, and winter clothing, the agency added. Last week, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a global aid agency, warned that the amount of aid entering Gaza on a daily basis is insufficient to respond to the needs of the residents.Israel’s hindering of aid delivery comes while the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Tom Fletcher, said on February 6 that “the scale of destruction and suffering is beyond my worst fears.” During the 15 months of the Israeli regime’s genocidal war against the people of Gaza that began in October 2023, over 48,000 were killed, most of them children and women.On January 15, the Israeli regime, having failed to achieve any of its war objectives including the “elimination” of Hamas or the release of captives, was forced to agree to a ceasefire deal with the Gaza-based resistance movement.
Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel is required to allow the entry of at least 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents into Gaza during the initial 42-day phase. It must also allow a specified amount of equipment for clearing rubble.Moreover, repairs to Gaza’s severely damaged electricity, water, sewage, and communications systems, along with its destroyed roads, will begin during the first phase.The planning process for rebuilding homes devastated by the war will begin as well.The UN, along with ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar, is to oversee all repairs and planning efforts.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Most Americans oppose Trump's plot to ‘take over’ Gaza: Poll Datetime: 20250213_090400 Content: A strong majority of American voters have expressed heir opposition to US President Donald Trump’s highly contentious plan to forcibly expel Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and “take over” the besieged territory, a new opinion poll shows.In a survey released on Wednesday, Data for Progress found that 64 percent of US voters say they oppose Trump’s proposal, while only 27 percent support it, a margin of 37 points.Nearly half of the survey’s 1,201 respondents, accounting for 47 percent, also said they “strongly” are against the plan.Data for Progress found that opposition was strongest among Democrats, with 85 percent disapproving of the proposal, including 78 percent “strongly” in opposition.A plurality of independents, 63 percent, disagreed to Trump’s plan for Gaza, while Republicans favored the proposal by a small margin, with 46 percent supporting and 43 percent opposing.
According to the poll, the proposal to forcibly expel Palestinian survivors of the US-backed Israeli genocide is more unpopular when American troops are involved. Data for Progress found that nearly seven in 10 voters say they oppose sending US troops to West Asia in order to take over Gaza, with 25 percent in favor.The poll was carried out in English from February 8 to 9, 2025, using web panels.The margin of error associated with the sample size is ±3 percentage points.On February 4, Trump hosted Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, DC.At a joint press conference there, Trump said he would take control of Gaza – possibly with the help of US troops – to create a “Riviera of the Middle East.” He had earlier suggested that displaced Palestinians could be resettled in neighboring Arab countries.Washington’s European allies, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt have rejected Trump’s plot, reiterating calls for the so-called two-state solution.

Title: Hamas says to conduct captive-prisoner exchange as planned if Israel honors commitments Datetime: 20250213_110600 Content: The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says will proceed with the sixth phase of captives-prisoner exchange on Saturday, contingent upon “Israel honoring its commitments.” Palestinian sources close to the negotiations said on Thursday that significant progress has been made in maintaining the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, facilitating the planned captive-prisoner exchange.“Hamas has confirmed to Egyptian officials its commitment...to conducting the sixth exchange of prisoners on time, on Saturday, as soon as Israel honors its commitment,” a source said.Meanwhile, mediators have secured a commitment from the Israeli regime to implement a humanitarian protocol starting on Thursday morning, another source said.
Hamas has sent a delegation led by its top negotiator and Gaza chief, Khalil al-Hayya, to Cairo for discussions with Egyptian officials to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, the group said in a statement. The statement added that recent meetings have centered on ensuring the full implementation of the agreement's terms, particularly the provision of shelters, the prompt delivery of prefabricated homes, tents, heavy machinery, medical supplies, fuel, and the ongoing flow of humanitarian assistance, along with all other specified provisions.Hamas earlier warned that the release of Israeli captives could be delayed due to violations of the ceasefire by the Israeli military, which has engaged in deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and restricting Palestinian movement to northern Gaza.
The truce that came into effect on January 19 has largely halted more than 15 months of genocide and seen Israeli captives released in batches in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. But the deal has come under increasing strain with Hamas blaming Israel for failing to meet its commitments under the agreement, including on aid, and citing the deaths of three Gazans at the weekend in fresh attacks.The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in a statement on Wednesday said 801 aid trucks had entered the Palestinian territory earlier in the day “through interactions with the Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire deal.” Despite this, OCHA cautioned that access to the war-torn region remains severely limited, with stringent restrictions on essential supplies, including fuel and medical equipment.
This comes as the Israeli regime has threatened to initiate a “new” war against Hamas, echoing US President Donald Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip unless all Israeli captives are released by Saturday. The warning came shortly after Hamas declared it would not bow down to US and Israeli threats regarding the captives' release under the fragile truce.Moreover, the al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad movement, warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel is responsible for the fate of captives held by the resistance in the Gaza Strip, adding that the resistance “will adhere to the ceasefire agreement in all its details as long as the enemy remains committed to it.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Rights groups call for release of Gaza’s healthcare workers abducted by Israel during war Datetime: 20250213_111100 Content: Four prominent human rights organizations have called for the release of hundreds of the Gaza Strip’s healthcare workers abducted by the Israeli regime during the genocidal war against the blockaded Palestinian territory.In a jointstatementon Wednesday, Children Not Numbers, Human Rights Watch, MedGlobal and Physicians for Human Rights - Israel urged all the parties in the Gaza ceasefire talks “to secure the release” of hundreds of essential healthcare workers from the war-torn territory who have been unlawfully detained by the Israeli military.“Physicians for Human Rights - Israel has collected testimonies revealing the severe conditions faced by detained healthcare workers, including torture, beatings, humiliation, starvation, isolation from legal representation, and incommunicado detention.
These individuals have been detained without charges and subjected to enforced disappearance, violating international law,” the statement read. The rights group stressed that these detentions have “devastated Gaza’s already decimated healthcare system”, emphasizing that releasing the abductees is a humanitarian imperative legally demanded under international humanitarian law.The detentions have crippled Gaza’s already shattered healthcare system, with over 500 medical personnel killed, the remaining staff “overwhelmed by more than 110,000 wounded civilians”, and the absence of a functional medical evaluation system exacerbating their suffering, they added, stressing that the release of detained health workers is “crucial to saving lives in Gaza's ongoing humanitarian crisis.” “Gaza's irreplaceable health workers - surgeons, pediatricians, gynecologists, obstetricians, orthopedists, and emergency responders - are vital for saving lives and sustaining essential medical services.
As hostage exchange negotiations progress, we call for unlawfully detained medical personnel to be released,” the signatories demanded. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said only half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain partially operational.The 15-month-long Israeli genocidal war, began in October 2023, has damaged or partly destroyed nearly all hospitals and just 38 percent of primary healthcare centers are functional.An estimated 25 percent of those injured face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israeli forces kill Palestinian youth over alleged car-ramming attempt in West Bank Datetime: 20250213_141100 Content: Israeli forces have fatally shot a Palestinian youth in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, saying he attempted to carry out a car-ramming attack against the regime's troops at a checkpoint.Issa Riyad Issa Jabali, 28, was killed by Israeli troops after they opened fire at his car near the Huwara checkpoint south of Nablus on Thursday morning, the official Palestinian news agencyWAFAreported, citing Palestinian security sources.The Israeli military alleged in a statement that the young man, a resident of Beita town located 13 kilometers (8.1 miles) southeast of Nablus, was trying to ram his car into the regime's soldiers stationed at the checkpoint.Israeli troops withheld Jabali’s body after the fatal shooting.
The Israeli military launched a large-scale offensive in the West Bank on January 21, just two days after a Gaza ceasefire deal between the Tel Aviv regime and Hamas came into effect. The onslaught has resulted in the displacement of more than 35,000 Palestinians from the Jenin, Tulkarm and Far’a refugee camps.According to the United Nations, some 90 percent of the residents of the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps have been forced to flee.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says displacement and destruction in the Jenin camp have turned the area into a “ghost town,” while the UN human rights office says the killings and the demolition of homes “indicate ongoing violations of international law.” Since the offensive began, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians.As of February 13, WAFA news agency has documented 73 killings, including 38 in Jenin, 15 in Tubas, seven in Nablus, eight in Tulkarm, three in al-Khalil, two in Bethlehem, and one in al-Quds.
There are 10 children, three women, and two elderly people among the fatalities. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Former Israeli military general admits regime's 'absolute failure' in Gaza Datetime: 20250213_171200 Content: The architect of the Israeli regime’s so-called “Generals’ Plan” to depopulate northern Gaza has described the entity's 16-month-long war in the besieged Gaza Strip as an "absolute failure." Writing in an opinion piece forYnet, a retired major general and the plan's creator Giora Eiland said that Israel had failed to achieve its aims in the blockaded Palestinian region."Israel has failed in three-and-a-half out of the four goals of the war: we have not demolished Hamas’ military power; we have not overthrown Hamas’ rule; we are not managing to return the residents...safely to their homes [in Israel], and as for the return of the abductees, the fourth goal – we have partially succeeded," he wrote.Eiland acknowledges that Hamas has not only prevented Israel from achieving its goals but has also secured its own.
He further stressed that the Hamas movement had, conversely, "achieved all of its goals, chief among them: continuing its rule in Gaza." Eiland added that part of the problem was that the Israeli authorities had treated Hamas as purely a "terrorist" organization when it had already established state power in Gaza. Rights groups saw the original plan as part of a long-term project of ethnic cleansing that would result in the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in the blockaded Palestinian region.
The plan sought to tighten the regime’s siege against the area, cut off humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians inside, and label those who remained there as combatants so it could target and kill them after declaring the area a "closed military zone.” The regime’s plan for the northern part of the Gaza Strip, through which it sought to starve the targeted area to advance its war goals, was already seen as “doomed to failure.” Former Israeli national security adviser Giora Eiland describes the recent war in Gaza as “a resounding failure” for Israel, acknowledging that Hamas has not only prevented Israel from achieving its goals but has also secured its ownpic.twitter.com/e3He19U4bc The vicious scheme was published by a forum of commanders and soldiers in the reserves in late September 2024.
In an interview on October 29, 2023, only weeks into the aggression, Eiland said that Israel needed to exert much stronger pressure on Hamas and other resistance groups to achieve total victory. "The fact that we are breaking down in the face of humanitarian aid to Gaza is a serious mistake...Gaza must be completely destroyed: terrible chaos, severe humanitarian crisis, cries to heaven..." And in December 2023 he suggested that if Hamas was not willing to discuss Israeli captives then humanitarian aid should be cut in the hope of ultimately deposing the Hamas leadership.There has been discussion about whether the Generals' Plan was partly underway during the Gaza war, which killed thousands of Palestinians and saw millions displaced.Israeli rights groups including Gisha, B'Tselem, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel and Yesh Din, said in October 2024 that there were "alarming signs" that the plan was being implemented.
Eiland's most recent comments come after Hamas said it would delay the release of the next tranche of Israeli captives "until further notice", accusing Israel of failing to comply with the terms of the ceasefire deal. On Tuesday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian resistance group did not release captives by midday February 15.Hamas later issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardizing it.Hamas has gradually been releasing captives since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19.But Hamas said on Monday it would not free any more captives over accusations that Israel was violating the deal.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Houthi vows Yemen’s military action if Trump’s Gaza displacement plan proceeds Datetime: 20250213_174200 Content: Yemen’s Ansarullah leader Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi has promised a “military action” if Israel or the US proceed with a plan to depopulate the Gaza Strip of its inhabitants and resettle them in other countries.“Our position concerning support for the Palestinian nation and their fighters is firm and principled, and we will resolutely stand by their side," he said in a televised speech from Yemeni capital Sana’a on Thursday."If the US succeeds in advancing its plot against Gaza, we will take military action to prevent it, and act within the framework of our religious duties.We will not sit idly by.” He added that Israel has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing the entry of aid, basic commodities and tents into the Strip.
Houthi took a swipe at the Zionist regime for violating the terms of the ceasefire in Gaza due to the encouragement of the deceitful US administration, which denies all rights. The Ansarullah chief also rejected the US president’s call for the cancellation of the Gaza ceasefire unless the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas frees all remaining Israeli captives by Saturday, stating that “Hell is for you (Donald Trump) and people of your kind like tyrants, criminals and oppressors.” Houthi emphasized that Trump’s Gaza displacement plan is more like a joke and naive talk from the president of a country that proclaims to be civilized.“Trump's plan to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland is a confiscation of a right from which many other rights are derived.
Trump is a criminal and accustomed to making careless and ridiculous remarks.” Houthi underlined that Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza reflects his insistence on the criminal plan to deny Palestinians’ rights and justice for them. “Trump's plan for Gaza is evil and cruel.It appears that he is serious about implementing the scheme, and is putting pressure on some Arab countries to accept it.We are not surprised by the US president’s plot as it shows the tyranny and criminal record of his country.There are no boundaries to the ambitions of Trump, who believes in the aggressive and unjust Zionist plan and seeks to realize it,” he stated.The Ansarullah leader stated that Trump, who unveiled the so-called “Deal of the Century” during his term in office, is now poised to perpetrate the “Crime of the Century” during his second term.
“Through his plan, Trump seeks to obtain what the Israeli aggression on Gaza failed to achieve, namely, displacing the Palestinians from their land. When the Americans raise the issue of displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, they seek to completely liquidate the Palestinian cause,” Houthi said.He warned that the plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians is part of the Zionist project that seeks to expand the occupying entity’s influence and is aimed at holy sites, especially the al-Aqsa Mosque.“Trump’s Gaza plan cannot succeed as long as Arabs, especially the Arab countries neighboring Palestine, do not accept it.A great responsibility lies with Arab and Muslim countries to clearly reject it, and more importantly express their vehement opposition.“The US seeks to entrap Arab regimes in a major scandal and act against the interests of their countries and peoples,” Houthi noted.
He warned that approving the American plan would have very serious consequences for the national security of Arab countries, and the entire West Asia region. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues despite ceasefire: UN Datetime: 20250213_184400 Content: The head of the United Nations infrastructure agency has warned that a humanitarian catastrophe continues in the Gaza Strip despite a ceasefire agreement that brought a "much-needed respite." Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), made a warning following a visit to the besieged Gaza Strip where a truce between Israel and Hamas has been in effect since January 19."In addition to immense human suffering, I also witnessed an unimaginable degree of the destruction of infrastructure and houses, and an overwhelming volume of rubble," da Silva was quoted as saying.The ceasefire suspended Israel's genocidal war that has killed more than 48,200 people, mostly women and children, and left the besieged strip in ruins.
The lack of aid before the ceasefire agreement had devastating effects on the people of Gaza, who endured critical food insecurity and the prospect of famine. The situation has been particularly dire in the north of Gaza, where humanitarian access significantly deteriorated since September 2024.In a statement, the Hamas resistance group said a delegation headed by top negotiator Khalil al-Haya, held talks with the mediators to review the process of implementing the agreement.It added that the negotiating team emphasized the implementation of all provisions, especially the delivery of shelters, prefabricated houses, tents, heavy equipment, medical supplies, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza.Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou also pointed out that the group's mediators are exerting pressure to complete the full implementation of the agreement, obliging Israel to abide by the humanitarian protocol and resume the prisoner-captive exchange process on Saturday.
He stressed that the language of threats and intimidation used by US President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu does not serve the interests of the implementation of the ceasefire. Hamas earlier announced that it would postpone the exchange due to Israeli violations of the deal.Israel has reportedly promised to put in place a humanitarian protocol starting this morning.This comes as mediators, Egypt and Qatar say they have overcome Gaza truce obstacles.Hamas has now confirmed it would implement the Gaza ceasefire deal and will release more Israeli captives as scheduled on Saturday.Israel has turned Gaza into the world's largest open-air prison, maintaining an 18-year blockade and forcing nearly 2 million of its 2.3 million residents into displacement amid dire shortages of food, water, and medicine due to deliberate restrictions.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas: Efforts underway to remove all obstacles to implement ceasefire deal Datetime: 20250213_233600 Content: The Hamas resistance movement has reiterated that it is ready to implement the Gaza ceasefire deal, including the exchange of prisoners, per the text of the agreement.The resistance movement said on Thursday that the latest round of talks in Cairo has been positive and efforts are underway to remove all the obstacles to implementing the agreement.“The talks were held in a positive atmosphere, with Egyptian and Qatari mediators reaffirming their commitment to addressing obstacles and filling gaps to ensure implementation.Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to the agreement as signed, including the prisoner exchange process according to the specified timeline,” the statement said.
Hamas stressed that the language of threat and intimidation used by US President Donald Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not serve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. The resistance movement said in the statement that a Hamas delegation, led by Dr.Khalil Al-Hayya, head of Hamas in Gaza and chief negotiator, “held discussions with the esteemed mediators to review the implementation of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement, particularly in light of continuous ‘Israeli’ violations.” “The delegation convened a meeting in Cairo with Lieutenant General Hassan Rashad, Head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Service, and held phone discussions with His Excellency Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar,” it stated.
The resistance movement also said that the delegation also held meetings and discussions with officials overseeing the negotiations in Egypt and Qatar, as well as with technical teams from the mediators monitoring the full implementation of the agreement. “All discussions and communications focused on the necessity of adhering to all provisions of the agreement, particularly ensuring the urgent delivery of shelter for our people, including prefabricated homes (caravans), tents, heavy machinery, medical supplies, fuel, and the continued flow of humanitarian aid as stipulated in the agreement,” it added.Meanwhile, senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said the pressure from Gaza ceasefire mediators on Israel has led to the regime’s renewed commitment to the terms of the truce deal.He made the remarks after the movement said an obstacle in the Gaza captive exchange process has been removed and the next round of prisoner swap will take place on Saturday.
He added that Hamas is ready to begin negotiations on the second phase of the agreement next Monday. Hamdan also said, "We have 48 hours to hand over the captives, and any obstruction by the occupation to the entry of caravans and heavy equipment into Gaza will lead to action by Hamas." Israel has turned Gaza into the world's largest open-air prison, maintaining an 18-year blockade and forcing nearly 2 million of its 2.3 million residents into displacement amid dire shortages of food, water, and medicine due to deliberate restrictions.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Vatican: Palestinians must 'stay on their land' Datetime: 20250214_025000 Content: A top Vatican official has rejected US President Donald Trump's displacement plan, saying "the Palestinian population must remain on its land." "This is one of the fundamental points of the Holy See: no deportations," Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said on Thursday on the sidelines of an Italy-Vatican meeting.He added that moving Palestinians out would cause regional tensions and "makes no sense" as neighboring countries such as Jordan are opposed."The solution in our opinion is that of two states because this also means giving hope to the population," he said.This is not the first time the Vatican opposes Trump’s policies.Pope Francis this week criticized Trump's plans for mass deportations of undocumented migrants in the United States, drawing a sharp response.In a letter to US bishops, the head of the Catholic Church called the deportations a major crisis.
It said sending back people who had fled their own countries in distress "damages the dignity" of the migrants. This came amid uproar caused by Trump’s call to take over the besieged Gaza Strip and relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries.Trump has repeatedly stated that Jordan and Egypt will take in Palestinians from the blockaded Palestinian region, an idea that Amman and Cairo have flatly rejected.The US president has suggested that he could deny aid to Jordan and Egypt if they didn't accept his proposal.“If they don’t agree, I would conceivably withhold aid.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israeli warplanes launch airstrikes against southern Lebanon in violation of ceasefire Datetime: 20250214_064600 Content: Israeli military aircraft have carried out a series of airstrikes, targeting several areas in the southern side of Lebanon in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement with the Arab country.Lebanon's private LBCI television station reported that the warplanes targeted localities near the Litani River, including the towns of Yohmor al-Shaqif and Zoutr al-Sharqiya, on Thursday night.The Israeli fighter jets also struck the municipalities of Deir Siryan, Zibqin and Yater.There were no immediate reports about possible causalities or the extent of damage caused.Hours later, the Israeli military said in a statement that its strikes targeted “military sites containing weapons and launchers” belonging to Hezbollah resistance movement.
After experiencing substantial losses during almost 14 months of hostilities and not accomplishing its objectives in its offensive against Lebanon, Israel had no choice but to accept a ceasefire with Hezbollah. The truce came into effect on November 27.Since the start of the agreement though, the occupation forces have been conducting near-daily attacks on Lebanon in violation of the ceasefire, including airstrikes across the Arab nation.On January 10, Lebanon lodged a formal complaint with the UN Security Council regarding Israeli acts of aggression targeting agricultural lands and livestock in the southern region of the country, in violation of the truce agreement.Hezbollah has placed the responsibility on the Lebanese government to guarantee the complete withdrawal of Israeli military forces from southern Lebanon.On January 27, Lebanon announced its agreement to extend the ceasefire with Israel until February 18.
This decision came despite the Israeli military's failure to adhere to a deadline for troop withdrawal and the reported fatalities of nearly two dozen individuals in the southern region of the country. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel bombs homes in Jenin as Palestine urges intl.action against West Bank aggression Datetime: 20250214_072200 Content: Israel has conducted a fresh drone attack on the Jenin refugee camp, as the Palestinian foreign ministry urges the international community to take a serious action to stop the regime’s intensified aggression on the occupied West Bank.In the early hours of Friday, media reports said an Israeli drone targeted homes in the Jenin camp in the northern part of the West Bank.Since a ceasefire in Gaza was announced last month, Israel has intensified its attacks in Jenin and other parts of the occupied West Bank.At least 25 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s raids in Jenin this year, which have also displaced nearly 20,000, according to the camp’s media committee.The Israeli army also continues to destroy homes and infrastructure in the West Bank city of Tulkarm and its two camps.
According to the Tulkarm Camp’s Media Committee, nine people have been killed, and about 10,500 others --around 80 percent of its population -- have been displaced since Israeli forces began the assault on the camp. Video footage showed Israeli bulldozers destroying homes in Tulkarm’s Nour Shams Refugee Camp on Thursday.The Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said at least 380 people have been detained by Israeli forces since the start of their large-scale military raids in the West Bank after the Gaza ceasefire went into effect on January 19.The deal between Israel and Hamas was reached after 15 months of the regime's genocidal war on the strip, which claimed the lives of at least 48,239 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 111,676 others.
The regime agreed to the ceasefire after falling short of realizing any of its wartime objectives, including freeing the captives, “eliminating” the Gazan resistance, and causing forced displacement of Gaza’s entire population to neighboring Egypt or Jordan. The Palestinian Foreign ministry on Thursday urged the international community to take “an urgent and effective action” to force Israel to stop its aggression on the West Bank.Referring to Israeli crimes in the occupied territories, including the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and the destruction of homes and infrastructure, the ministry said the international silence emboldens Israel to commit more crimes and enables it to continue its crime of ethnic cleansing.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Yemenis hold mass rallies in solidarity with Palestine, Axis of Resistance Datetime: 20250214_110900 Content: Tens of thousands of people have staged mass rallies in Yemen’s northwestern province of Sa’ada, reiterating their unflinching stance in support of the people of Palestine, their legitimate cause as well as the Axis of Resistance.According to Yemen’s al-Masirah television channel, Yemenis held demonstrations in dozens of districts and regions across the province, including Majz, Ghamr, al-Dhaher, Baqim, Kitaf wa al-Boqe'e, al-Hashwah, Monabbih and Qatabir, on Friday, expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of Palestine, and condemned the US president’s plan to take over Gaza and relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt.The demonstrators waved flags of Palestine and Yemen, while chanting slogans in denunciation of Donald Trump’s Gaza displacement scheme.
They also chanted slogans in support of the Yemeni Ansarullah movement and other forces of the Axis of Resistance. In their slogans, the demonstrators emphasized that they are not afraid of the United States and Israel, and will not allow the fiendish plot to proceed.Houthi to Trump: Gaza displacement plan will fail During the massive rally in the provincial capital of Sa’ada, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, a member of Yemen's Supreme Political Council, addressed the US president, saying, “Your military power and the support you offered to the occupier (Israel) will not force the Palestinian people to leave their homeland.” He stressed that Yemen stands by Palestine, and the US will witness the full extent of the Yemeni military prowess – something it hasn’t experienced so far.“The missiles and forces you dispatched to Palestinian territories will fail to displace the people of Gaza.
Your statements will not materialize, and will not manage to force the Yemeni nation into abandoning their position,” Houthi said. He stressed that Yemeni people and their armed forces are on alert closely monitoring the unfolding developments.The senior Yemeni official also pointed to the collision of the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S.Truman with a large merchant vessel on Wednesday night in the Mediterranean Sea, saying the incident exposes the anxiety and distress that the US Navy is enduring as a result of battles with the Yemeni armed forces.He stated that all options are on the table, and Yemeni armed forces stand fully prepared for any possible scenario, especially after recent remarks by Ansarulalh leader Abul-Malik al-Houthi that Yemen will intervene, even militarily, if the US and Israel attempt to enforce the Gaza displacement plan by force or collude with Arab regimes to implement it.
Houthi reiterated Yemeni people's support for the Palestinian nation for the past 15 months, adding that their million-man marches attest to such a stance. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel killed 360,000 Palestinians in Gaza; real toll 'severely under-reported’: Renowned American attorney Datetime: 20250212_104800 Content: A renowned American attorney and indigenous rights campaigner estimates that the Israeli military has killed at least 360,000 people in its 15-month-long genocidal war on the Gaza Strip, arguing that the besieged territory’s true death toll is significantly higher than the figure reported by mainstream media.Steven Donziger, who spent decades battling Chevron over pollution in the Ecuadorian rainforest, made the assertion on Wednesday, as he criticized the “narrow and incomplete” death count in Gaza, which “is severely under-reported” in international news outlets.“Official data from the Gaza Ministry of Health reports approximately 46,000 deaths, but this figure only includes direct fatalities from bombings and missile strikes.
It does not take into account the widespread indirect deaths from starvation, disease, and lack of medical care caused by the destruction of Gaza’s health infrastructure and the blockade imposed by Israel,” he said. He went on to say that as of January 19, 2024, the number of deaths in Gaza, including both direct and indirect causes, could be as high as 306,000, according to his analysis.The Harvard-trained lawyer further compared this figure to the population of the United States, stating that if the same proportion of Americans had died in a conflict, it would be equivalent to 46 million people, or about 14% of the country’s population.
While acknowledging that these estimates are not precise, he maintained that they reflect the scale of the human tragedy in Gaza, saying, “I have a great deal of confidence that our calculation accurately captures the shocking scale of what has happened—and continues to happen.” Donziger’s figures are based on a study published by the UK’sLancetmedical journal in June 2023 estimating that the accumulative effects of Israel’s war on Gaza could mean the true death toll could reach more than 186,000 people. From this, Donziger calculated that with an additional 214 days of fighting until the ceasefire in January 2024, the total death toll would have risen to approximately 306,000.Also in January this year,The Lancetpublished a study estimating that Gaza's death toll during the first nine months of the war was about 40 percent higher than figures reported by the Palestinian Health Ministry.
The study suggested the total death toll was actually at around 64,260, which would mean the health ministry had under-reported the number of deaths by 41 percent. The new study used data from the ministry, an online survey and social media obituaries to estimate that there were between 55,298 and 78,525 deaths from traumatic injuries in Gaza by that time.Earlier, a UN report had indicated that around 10,000 missing Gazans are probably buried under rubble.The number of dead in Gaza has been a matter of bitter debate since Israel launched its genocidal campaign against the blockaded territory on October 7, 2023, after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas carried out a historic operation against the usurping entity in retaliation for its intensified atrocities against the Palestinian people.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: South Africa won't withdraw genocide case against Israel after Trump threatens to cut off aid Datetime: 20250212_152300 Content: South Africa says it will not withdraw its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) despite US President Donald Trump’s order to freeze Washington’s aid to the country.Trump signed an executive order Friday aimed at freezing "foreign aid or assistance” to South Africa in retaliation for the ICJ case and a new land expropriation law it claims is designed to seize property from the country’s Afrikaner minority.The US president claimed that Pretoria had taken an aggressive stance against the United States and its allies through its position on Israel.South Africa’s Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said Wednesday that there is “no chance” of Pretoria withdrawing the case it filed against the Israeli regime in December 2023.
“Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world, and the rule of law.” South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court in December 2023. It said Tel Aviv was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and called for the court to order a halt to Israel’s genocidal campaign in the Strip.While a final ruling is pending, the court ruled last year that “there is a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and the continuing serious harm to civilians since then.” Many countries have followed suit and supported South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, whose 15 months of brutal campaign of death and destruction claimed the lives of more than 48,000 Palestinians in Gaza and left the besieged coastal enclave in ruins.The war came to a halt after Hamas and Israel reached a ceasefire agreement on January 19.
Still, Trump threatened on Monday that he will call for cancellation of the ceasefire and “let all hell break out,” if Hamas does not release all of the captives by noon on February 15. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel orders forced displacement of Palestinians in Nur Shams refugee camp Datetime: 20250212_153600 Content: Israel has ordered the immediate evacuation of Palestinian residents from the Nur Shams refugee camp in the northern part of the occupied West Bank as the regime escalates its military offensive.The military raids in the city of Tulkarm and its camps, including Nur Shams, have entered the 17th consecutive day.The Nur Shams refugee camp had been under Israeli siege for at least four days.On Wednesday, the Israeli regime ordered the evacuation of the residents.Eyewitnesses reported that “occupation forces stormed a mosque in the camp and used loudspeakers to call on residents to leave, as the camp has been under attack for the past four days.” Israeli forces deployed foot soldiers, military vehicles, and sound bombs at the camp’s alleyways and entrances.They repeatedly fired live bullets and sound bombs to create fear and panic among the refugees.
The refugees described the situation as “extremely difficult, with homes and shops destroyed, streets leveled, and soldiers brutally raiding homes, and breaking furniture.” Israeli forces “assaulted young men, expelled the elderly without letting them take basic items like clothing, and confiscated mobile phones,” the refugees said. According to the Media Office of the Nur Shams Camp Services Committee, “thousands of displaced people, including women, children, the elderly, and the sick, have fled the camp.” The Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank are marked by widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and property, arrests, and forced displacement of thousands of refugees.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday that the operations in the occupied West Bank have led to the forced displacement of at least 40,000 refugees from the Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur Shams, and Al-Far’a camps.
Since January 15, when the Israeli regime reached a ceasefire agreement with Palestinian resistance groups, it has increased its heinous actions in the occupied West Bank, including destroying civilian infrastructure, houses and refugee camps.

Title: Israel says will stay in Lebanon beyond extended withdrawal deadline Datetime: 20250212_164200 Content: The Israeli military says it will stay in Lebanon even after the extended deadline for the withdrawal of the regime forces under the ceasefire, warning local residents in southern Lebanon not to return to their homes.In a post on X on Wednesday, the Israeli army’s Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee made the “urgent announcement” in Arabic, addressing “the people of Lebanon, especially South Lebanon.” “The period of implementation of the agreement has been extended and” the Israeli military “is still deployed in the field, thus moving south is forbidden,” he said, warning that “Anyone moving south is putting themselves in danger.” Israel was supposed to have withdrawn all its forces from Lebanon by January 26 under the truce deal it signed with the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah in November.However, it refused to do so, and the deadline was extended to February 18.
Adraee further claimed that the regime’s forces have “no intention of harming you”, adding, “For your safety, you are prohibited from returning to your homes in the affected areas until further notice.” More than 80 Lebanese have already been killed in Israeli attacks on the Arab country since the ceasefire came into force. Israel wanted to remain in at least five military posts in Lebanon until February 28, 10 more days after the extended deadline for the withdrawal, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed Lebanese official and a foreign diplomat.Lebanese representatives on the ceasefire oversight committee, which includes officials from the United States, France, Israel, and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), have rejected Tel Aviv’s request.Early this week, Washington reportedly told Tel Aviv that Israeli troops must withdraw from southern Lebanon by February 18, with no further extensions to the ceasefire being granted.
Lebanon says Israel violated the ceasefire agreement and has thus lodged a complaint against the occupying entity with the United Nations Security Council. According to Lebanese media, there have been over 830 Israeli violations since the ceasefire took effect at the end of November.The original agreement mandated that Lebanon’s military deploy alongside UN peacekeepers as Israel withdrew, while Hezbollah was to retreat north of the Litani River.After experiencing substantial losses during almost 14 months of hostilities and not accomplishing its aims in its offensive against Lebanon, Israel had no choice but to accept a ceasefire with Hezbollah.The truce came into effect on November 27.Since the start of the agreement though, the occupation forces have been conducting near-daily attacks on Lebanon in violation of the ceasefire, including airstrikes across the Arab country.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Senior Arab officials warn Trump's Gaza scheme could inflame West Asia Datetime: 20250212_172100 Content: Senior Arab officials have warned that US President Donald Trump’s vicious scheme to take over the Gaza Strip and resettle Palestinians will fuel regional instability.Addressing the World Government Summit in Dubai on Wednesday, Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said if Trump pressed ahead with his plan, he would lead West Asia into a new cycle of crises with a “damaging effect on peace and stability.” Jasem al-Budaiwi, who heads the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council political and economic alliance, called on Trump to remember the strong ties between the region and Washington.
“But there has to be give and take, he says his opinion and Arab world should say theirs; what he is saying won’t be accepted by the Arab world." The Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) have already condemned in the strongest terms Trump’s remarks on the “takeover” of Gaza. Meanwhile, two Egyptian security sources said President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi will not travel to Washington for talks at the White House if the agenda includes Trump’s plan to displace the Palestinians from Gaza.Sisi has repeatedly said Egypt would never participate in a large displacement of Palestinians across the border.In a call between Trump and Sisi on February 1, the US president extended an open invitation to Sisi to visit the White House.No date has been set for any such visit, a US official said.Trump enraged the Muslim world and beyond by declaring unexpectedly that the United States would take over Gaza and resettle its over two million population in neighboring countries.
Trump has said the Palestinians in Gaza could settle in countries like Jordan, and Egypt, the Arab world’s most populous state. Both have rejected the proposal.Egypt will host an emergency Arab summit on February 27 to discuss “serious” developments for Palestinians.Trump’s plan has upended decades of US policy that endorsed a two-state solution.The US president has said the Palestinians would have no right to return.Palestinians fear a repeat of the “Nakba,” or catastrophe, when nearly 800,000 people were forced out of their homeland during the 1948 war that led to the illegal creation of Israel.On Tuesday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian resistance group did not release captives by midday February 15.Hamas later issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardizing it.
Hamas has gradually been releasing captives since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19. But Hamas said on Monday it would not free any more captives over accusations that Israel was violating the deal.“If the situation explodes militarily once more, all this (ceasefire) effort will be wasted,” Aboul Gheit said.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: CPJ: Israel responsible for 2024 being deadliest year in history for journalists Datetime: 20250212_173600 Content: The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has said that 2024 was the deadliest year in recorded history for journalists with 124 deaths, and the Israeli regime is responsible for 70 percent of the total.CPJ said on Wednesday that 2024 was the deadliest year since the organization started keeping records with 124 journalists killed across the globe.The global increase in killings (a 22 percent increase from 2023) was largely because of the Israeli regime’s genocidal war in Gaza, CPJ said.At least 85 journalists were killed during the 15-month war in Gaza, all at the hands of the Israeli regime’s forces, CPJ said.82 of the killed journalists during this period were Palestinian.“Today is the most dangerous time to be a journalist in CPJ’s history,” said CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg.
“The war in Gaza is unprecedented in its impact on journalists and demonstrates a major deterioration in global norms on protecting journalists in conflict zones,” she added. “In Gaza and Lebanon, CPJ documented … cases where journalists were murdered by the Israeli military, in defiance of international laws that define journalists as civilians during conflict,” she said.“Thirty-one of freelancers were killed in Gaza.Many Gaza journalists became freelancers after their outlets were destroyed … their coverage proving crucial for global media outlets because Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering the Strip,” she stated.CPJ is also investigating 20 further killings in which it believes the Israeli regime may have specifically targeted journalists."We know in most of these cases that Israel knew these individuals were journalists and killed them anyway, which is if that is the case, a war crime," Ginsberg said.
"In some cases, we know it because Israel told us that they killed those individuals." The Gaza Government Media Office puts the number of journalists being killed by the Israeli regime far above the CPJ statistics. According to the Gaza Government Media Office, the Israeli regime has killed at least 205 journalists in Gaza alone since October 7, 2023.A ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement went into effect in Gaza on January 19, halting Israel's campaign of genocide in the Palestinian territory.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Islamic Jihad warns fate of Israeli captives depends on Netanyahu's actions Datetime: 20250212_181500 Content: The Palestinian Islamic Jihad warns Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel is responsible for the fate of captives held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad movement, said in a Wednesday statement that Palestinian resistance has fulfilled its duties and commitments in the ceasefire agreement, “while the enemy has left its captives in danger and an uncertain fate.” “The fate of the prisoners held by the resistance is directly tied to Netanyahu's actions, for better or worse.” It said that the resistance “will adhere to the ceasefire agreement in all its details as long as the enemy remains committed to it.” Al-Quds Brigades issued the warning after Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, threatened on Tuesday to withdraw from the ceasefire deal with Hamas and resume “intense fighting” in the Gaza Strip if Hamas does not release more captives by midday February 15. Under the ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19, the resistance is scheduled to release three Israeli captives each Saturday.
Israel’s minister of military affairs Israel Katzalso threatened on Wednesday that if Hamas does not release Israeli captives by Saturday, "the gates of hell will open on them [Gazans], just as the US president promised.” Katz was referring to Donald Trump’s recent threat that he will call for cancellation of the ceasefire and “let all hell break out,” if Hamas does not release all of the captives by noon on February 15. The Israel minister claimed that the new war on Gaza will be "different in intensity" and "will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages." Hamas won’t accept ‘language of threats’ In a separate statement, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said Wednesday that the resistance group’s “position is clear.” He said Hamas “will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats.” Qassem reiterated that “Israel must commit to implementing the terms of the ceasefire agreement for the release” of the captives.
During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, 33 Israeli captives are to be released in exchange for almost 2,000 Palestinian abductees. Hamas warned earlier this week that it could delay the release of Israeli captives, since the regime’s military has violated the ceasefire deal, by carrying out deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and inhibiting Palestinians' passage to northern Gaza.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas rejects US-Israeli 'threats' on captive exchange Datetime: 20250212_182900 Content: The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says it will not bow down to threats from Israel and the United States on the issue of captives.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said on Wednesday that Israel was "evading the implementation of several provisions of the ceasefire agreement," warning that captives would not be released without Israel complying with the deal."Our position is clear, and we will not accept the language of American and Israeli threats," said Qassem, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to "resume intense fighting" if captives were not released by Saturday.On Wednesday, the regime’s military affairs minister warned Israel will restart its war on Gaza if Hamas fails to release Israeli captives and that this time it will be more devastating.
“The new Gaza war will be different in intensity from the one before the ceasefire, and it will not end without the defeat of Hamas and the release of all the hostages,” Israeli Katz said in a statement. “It will also allow the realization of US President [Donald] Trump’s vision for Gaza,” Katz said, referring to the American leader’s plan for the United States to take over the Palestinian territory.Those threats echoed Trump, who said on Monday that "hell" would break loose if Hamas failed to release "all" Israeli captives by then.Hamas negotiators in Egypt Hamas earlier said in a statement that a delegation headed by its top negotiator and Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya "arrived in Cairo and began meetings with Egyptian officials" and was monitoring "the implementation of the ceasefire agreement." A diplomat familiar with the talks told AFP that mediators from Qatar and Egypt were engaged with both Israel and Hamas to resolve the dispute and ensure the implementation of the agreement.
The truce has largely halted more than 15 months of genocide and seen Israeli captives released in batches in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. But the deal has come under increasing strain with Hamas accusing Israel of failing to meet its commitments under the agreement, including on aid, and citing the deaths of three Gazans at the weekend in fresh attacks.Hamas has said it would postpone the next captive exchange scheduled for Saturday, citing Israeli violations.Israel and Hamas have so far carried out five rounds of captive exchange under the first phase, which was to last for 42 days.The regime and Hamas have yet to agree on the next phases of the truce.UN chief Antonio Guterres has urged Hamas to proceed with the planned release and "avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza."

Title: Putin talks Russia-Syria cooperation in first phone call with Jolani Datetime: 20250212_191900 Content: Russian President Putin has spoken with HTS leader Mohammad al-Jolani on the phone, offering his nation's support in safeguarding Syria's “sovereignty and territorial integrity.” “The sides held a substantive exchange of views on the current situation in Syria,” a statement issued by the Kremlin says.“The Russian side stressed its principled position in support of the unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Syrian state,” the press service said.The call confirmed Russia's continued readiness to help improve the socio-economic situation in Syria, including providing humanitarian aid to its residents.
Putin also “emphasized the importance of implementing a number of measures in the interest of establishing a sustainable normalization of relations in the country, activating the inter-Syrian dialogue with the participation of all leading political forces and ethno-confessional groups of the population.” An agreement was reached to continue such contacts to elaborate a broad agenda for the development of bilateral cooperation, it said. Wednesday's call was the first time the Russian president officially spoke with Jolani.Jolani was appointed president for a “transitional phase” last month by the military operations department of the de facto administration.Following the entry of HTS and other extremist groups to the Syrian capital Damascus on December 8, the Kremlin granted President Assad and his family asylum in Moscow.
On January 28, a Russian delegation, which included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Russian envoy to Syria Alexander Lavrentyev, met with Julani in Damascus. The recent appointment of Julani as Syria’s president without constitutional legitimacy has reignited and increased concerns in the country already going through critical days.Protesters recently gathered in Damascus to demand an inclusive National Dialogue Conference.However, the peaceful demonstration was quickly forced to disperse, exposing deepening tensions over Syria’s uncertain transition to democracy.The Kremlin has been in talks with the Western-backed HTS rulers to keep control of its key military bases in Syria, notably the Hmeimim airbase near the port city of Latakia and the Tartous naval base.In December, President Putin publicly stated that the future of his country’s military bases in Syria would rely on the actions of the HTS administration.

Title: Egypt, Jordan urge ‘unity’ on Gaza, rebuilding without relocation Datetime: 20250212_192300 Content: Egypt and Jordan have underscored ‘unity’ on the issue of the Gaza Strip, calling for rebuilding the Palestinian territory without relocating Gazans.US President Donald Trump has proposed to relocate Gaza's entire population before taking over the territory.In a statement on Wednesday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II emphasized the “unity” of Cairo and Amman on their position on the fate of Gaza, just a day after the Jordanian leader and Trump held talks in Washington.“The two leaders affirmed the unity of the Egyptian and Jordanian positions,” on the reconstruction of the war-torn territory, “without displacing the Palestinian people from their land,” read a statement from the Egyptian presidency.
Separately, the Jordanian royal court said in a statement that Sisi and King Abdullah stressed their “shared position” in rejecting the forced displacement of Gazans. According to both statements, the two leaders also referred to their willingness to “cooperate” with the US president to achieve “just and lasting peace” in West Asia.Last week, Trump said the US was seeking Gaza’s “ownership” as part of a plan that he wheeled out under the guise of “rebuilding” the war-wrecked Palestinian territory, proposing the relocation of some 2.4 million Gazans to Egypt and Jordan.Cairo and Amman had earlier strongly rejected the highly provocative plan by Trump, who has threatened he might halt aid to both nations if they refuse to take in Palestinian refugees.
“This is the unified Arab position,” King Abdullah wrote on social media following his meeting with Trump on Tuesday, stressing that Jordan remains “steadfast” in its position against the forced relocation of Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Egypt will host an Arab summit this month, presenting a “comprehensive vision” for Gaza’s reconstruction while ensuring Palestinians stay on their land.Egypt and Jordan, key US allies, depend heavily on foreign aid, with the US among their top donors.Trump’s proposal to relocate Palestinians came as a ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since January 19.His proposal was met with condemnations from the Palestinians, Arab countries, and many other nations across the world, including US allies Canada, France, Germany, and Britain.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Iran slams US allegations against Tehran concerning Syria, condemns sanctions, Israeli violations Datetime: 20250212_231600 Content: Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations has strongly rejected the US’s accusations against the Islamic Republic of “destabilizing” Syria, calling them “baseless” and a deliberate distortion of reality aimed at misleading the international community.Addressing a UN Security Council session on Syria on Wednesday, Amir Saeid Iravani condemned Washington’s narrative, highlighting its own violations of the Syrian sovereignty under the pretext of counterterrorism.“The accusations made by the US representative against my country are completely unfounded,” he said.
“These claims are crafted solely to distort the truth and mislead the international community.” “The reality is that the United States has long violated Syria’s sovereignty, provided safe havens for terrorist groups, and supported Israel’s aggression—all in pursuit of its geopolitical ambitions.” The envoy was responding to remarks made by Deputy US Ambassador to the world body, Dorothy Shea, who had alleged that Iran “continued to back” militant groups inside Syria and was seeking to “reestablish its military presence” in the war-torn country. Iravani categorically dismissed the claims, emphasizing that Iran remained committed to Syria’s sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity.‘US sanctions hindering Syria’s recovery’ The high-ranking Iranian diplomat, meanwhile, turned the focus towards the humanitarian and economic crisis in Syria, criticizing the “unjust and unlawful” sanctions that had been imposed by the United States and the European Union against the Arab country.
He stressed that such extraterritorial measures were severely hindering Syria’s reconstruction efforts and disproportionately harming ordinary citizens. “Temporary relief or limited humanitarian exemptions are not a sustainable solution,” he said.“These illegal measures must be fully lifted to allow the Syrian people to rebuild their country and return to a life of dignity.” The ambassador also argued that the sanctions directly obstructed early recovery projects necessary for Syria’s long-term stability, adding that their removal was essential for safe and voluntary return of millions of displaced Syrians.On resurgence of terrorism in Syria Iravani further raised the issue of the growing threat of terrorism in Syria.He noted that “foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs)” and extremist groups interfering in the Arab country continued to pose a significant danger to both regional and global security.
“The risk of advanced weapons stockpiles falling into the hands of terrorists is real,” he warned, citing UN reports that an estimated 42,500 individuals with suspected ties to the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group -- which was vanquished by Syria and its allies, including Iran and Russia, in 2017 -- remained in detention camps in northeastern Syria. The official called for a structured and accountable process for repatriating these individuals to their home countries and holding them legally accountable.“Iran remains firmly committed to combating terrorism and is prepared to cooperate with legitimate international partners to address this critical challenge.” Condemnation of Israeli aggression Iravani also lambasted the Israeli regime’s ongoing violations of the Syrian sovereignty, denouncing Tel Aviv for systematically targeting the country’s military and research infrastructure with US backing.
“Israel continues to be a serious threat to Syria, repeatedly violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “Despite numerous Security Council resolutions, the regime refuses to withdraw from the occupied Golan Heights and instead expands its occupation.” Iravani, therefore, urged the Security Council to take decisive action against the Israeli aggression and to hold the regime accountable for its attacks on the Syrian territory.Call for political dialogue, Syrian-led future Reaffirming Iran’s stance on Syria’s future, Iravani stressed that only the Syrian people had to determine their country’s path, free from external interference.He reiterated the Islamic Republic’s support for formation of an inclusive government in Syria based on national dialog and proportional representation, with UN Resolution 2254 -- which called for a ceasefire and political settlement in Syria in 2015 -- providing the necessary framework for constitutional reform.
“The future of Syria must be determined solely by its people,” he asserted. “Iran fully supports the formation of a government through free elections, ensuring a fair process that reflects the will of all Syrians.” Iran’s commitment to stability in Syria In conclusion, the Iranian ambassador reaffirmed the country’s role as a constructive partner in efforts to achieve lasting peace in Syria.He expressed full support for the UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen’s efforts and called for a greater international commitment to Syria’s reconstruction and stabilization.Iran remains dedicated to working in coordination with the United Nations and regional partners to achieve lasting peace and stability in Syria, Iravani stated.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel mounts West Bank raids; 44,000 Palestinians displaced in military offensive since Jan.21 Datetime: 20250213_071000 Content: The Israeli military has conducted more raids in several cities and refugee camps across the occupied West Bank, firing indiscriminately at Palestinians and violently forcing them out of their homes.Reports said the Israeli attacks took place at the Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur Shams, Askar, and Balata refugee camps, all situated in the northern West Bank, sparking clashes with local Palestinians.Other raids, the reports added, targeted the Shu’fat, Aida, and al-Arroub camps, near the cities of al-Quds, Bethlehem and al-Khalil, respectively.Meanwhile, Israeli forces stormed the city of Nablus as well as the towns of Yatta and Attil.In the Nur Shams camp, the occupation troops demolished and ransacked Palestinian houses, and ordered residents to evacuate.
The head of the Popular Committee for Services in Nur Shams, Nihad al-Shawish, said the situation inside the camp is extremely dire amid the ongoing Israeli assault. Israeli soldiers are firing at everything that moves inside the camp, he noted.Many families remain trapped in their homes, facing imminent danger, while essential services such as water and electricity have been cut off.Shawish also said the Israeli military is brutally mistreating residents, storming their homes by force, firing live bullets and stun grenades, and threatening them to leave in an apparent effort to empty the camp of its residents.The Israeli military launched its offensive against the occupied West Bank on January 21, claiming that it was targeting resistance fighters of the Jenin Battalion.Israel has ramped up West Bank violence since October 7, 2023, when it launched its genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.Since then, the regime forces have killed at least 910 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
The Israeli army continued for the 22nd day its attacks on the Jenin refugee camp. More than 20,000 people were evicted by force from their homes.The army caused huge damage to people’s homes and the infrastructure of the camp.pic.twitter.com/ImUWpuV3KZ '44,000 Palestinians displaced in northern West Bank' The Israeli invasion has displaced 44,000 Palestinians in the northern West Bank since January 21, according to the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).“What we are witnessing in the West Bank is the worst situation since the second Intifada...The patterns of attacks and methods used are also similar to those seen during Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza,” Diana Alzeer, FIDH’s vice president, said, calling for “serious” global pressure on Israeli authorities to end their deadly attacks in the West Bank.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas calls for 'solidarity marches' worldwide against US-Israel 'ethnic cleansing' Datetime: 20250213_082600 Content: The Palestinian resistance group Hamas has called for worldwide protests and “solidarity marches” over the weekend for unified international response to the US-Israeli plan of “ethnic cleansing” in Palestine.Hamas in a statement on Wednesday called people around the globe to participate in mass demonstrations in capital cities, and let the coming Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays be a global movement against the regime's genocide of the oppressed people of Gaza.“We ...call on the masses of our people, our Arab and Islamic nation, and the free people of the world to go out in massive solidarity marches” from Friday through Sunday to denounce “the plans to displace our Palestinian people from their land,” Hamas said in the statement.
The movement said that the demonstrations are a show of support for the Palestinian people's inalienable right to defend their territory, and their right to freedom, independence, and self-determination. Hamas also expressed gratitude for the worldwide support and solidarity in favor of the people of Gaza during the 15 months of Israel’s genocide.The statement came on the day Israel threatened to launch a “new” war on Hamas and implement US President Donald Trump’s plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip if Hamas does not release all the Israeli captives by Saturday.The remarks by the regime’s military affairs minister Israel Katz came shortly after Hamas said it would not bow down to US and Israeli “threats” over the release of captives under a fragile truce deal.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said that Israel was "evading the implementation of several provisions of the ceasefire agreement," warning that captives would not be released without Israel complying with the deal.
Meanwhile, Hamas said in a statement that a delegation headed by its top negotiator and Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya had "arrived in Cairo and began meetings with Egyptian officials" and was monitoring "the implementation of the ceasefire agreement." The ceasefire was initiated last month between the Israeli regime and Hamas in the hope of ending a ferocious war of genocide by the regime that killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Ever since the ceasefire took effect on January 19, the regime’s military has violated the ceasefire deal, by carrying out deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and medical supplies and inhibiting Palestinians' passage to northern Gaza.Furthermore, the Israeli regime has significantly intensified its attacks on West Bank residents, killing more than 900 Palestinians, with United Nations reports indicating that 44,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced from their homes in the region.

Title: Israel still restricting vital aid to Gaza Strip as 801 trucks enter: UN Datetime: 20250213_083800 Content: Israel is still severely restricting the amount of essential humanitarian aid deliveries to the blockaded Gaza Strip, aid organizations warn, in violation of a ceasefire in place between Tel Aviv and the Palestinian Hamas resistance movement.In a statement on Wednesday, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 801 aid trucks had entered the Palestinian territory earlier in the day “through interactions with the Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire deal.” Nevertheless, it warned that access to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory is still tightly limited, with severe restrictions on vital items such as fuel and medical equipment.
The UN agency added that the world body and its partners, however, spare no effort to seize any opportunity provided by the shaky truce “to scale up the provision of water, food, shelter, health, sanitation, hygiene, clothing, education and other assistance to the people of Gaza.” OCHA also noted that the Israeli army's acts of aggression in northern areas of the occupied West Bank “continue to cause civilian casualties and displacement, as well as damage to infrastructure.” Separately, UNRWA, the UN refugee agency that works primarily with the Palestinians being oppressed by the Israeli regime, said that it successfully delivered food to 1.2 million people in Gaza during the first two weeks of the ceasefire. “As of last week, UNRWA was hosting about 120,000 people in 120 shelters, including more than three dozen that opened since the ceasefire,” it added.
Furthermore, it managed to establish 37 new shelters in northern Gaza, providing displaced families with essential supplies, including tents, blankets, and winter clothing, the agency added. Last week, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a global aid agency, warned that the amount of aid entering Gaza on a daily basis is insufficient to respond to the needs of the residents.Israel’s hindering of aid delivery comes while the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Tom Fletcher, said on February 6 that “the scale of destruction and suffering is beyond my worst fears.” During the 15 months of the Israeli regime’s genocidal war against the people of Gaza that began in October 2023, over 48,000 were killed, most of them children and women.On January 15, the Israeli regime, having failed to achieve any of its war objectives including the “elimination” of Hamas or the release of captives, was forced to agree to a ceasefire deal with the Gaza-based resistance movement.
Under the ceasefire agreement, Israel is required to allow the entry of at least 60,000 temporary homes and 200,000 tents into Gaza during the initial 42-day phase. It must also allow a specified amount of equipment for clearing rubble.Moreover, repairs to Gaza’s severely damaged electricity, water, sewage, and communications systems, along with its destroyed roads, will begin during the first phase.The planning process for rebuilding homes devastated by the war will begin as well.The UN, along with ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar, is to oversee all repairs and planning efforts.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Most Americans oppose Trump's plot to ‘take over’ Gaza: Poll Datetime: 20250213_090400 Content: A strong majority of American voters have expressed heir opposition to US President Donald Trump’s highly contentious plan to forcibly expel Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and “take over” the besieged territory, a new opinion poll shows.In a survey released on Wednesday, Data for Progress found that 64 percent of US voters say they oppose Trump’s proposal, while only 27 percent support it, a margin of 37 points.Nearly half of the survey’s 1,201 respondents, accounting for 47 percent, also said they “strongly” are against the plan.Data for Progress found that opposition was strongest among Democrats, with 85 percent disapproving of the proposal, including 78 percent “strongly” in opposition.A plurality of independents, 63 percent, disagreed to Trump’s plan for Gaza, while Republicans favored the proposal by a small margin, with 46 percent supporting and 43 percent opposing.
According to the poll, the proposal to forcibly expel Palestinian survivors of the US-backed Israeli genocide is more unpopular when American troops are involved. Data for Progress found that nearly seven in 10 voters say they oppose sending US troops to West Asia in order to take over Gaza, with 25 percent in favor.The poll was carried out in English from February 8 to 9, 2025, using web panels.The margin of error associated with the sample size is ±3 percentage points.On February 4, Trump hosted Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, DC.At a joint press conference there, Trump said he would take control of Gaza – possibly with the help of US troops – to create a “Riviera of the Middle East.” He had earlier suggested that displaced Palestinians could be resettled in neighboring Arab countries.Washington’s European allies, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt have rejected Trump’s plot, reiterating calls for the so-called two-state solution.

Title: Hamas says to conduct captive-prisoner exchange as planned if Israel honors commitments Datetime: 20250213_110600 Content: The Palestinian resistance movement Hamas says will proceed with the sixth phase of captives-prisoner exchange on Saturday, contingent upon “Israel honoring its commitments.” Palestinian sources close to the negotiations said on Thursday that significant progress has been made in maintaining the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, facilitating the planned captive-prisoner exchange.“Hamas has confirmed to Egyptian officials its commitment...to conducting the sixth exchange of prisoners on time, on Saturday, as soon as Israel honors its commitment,” a source said.Meanwhile, mediators have secured a commitment from the Israeli regime to implement a humanitarian protocol starting on Thursday morning, another source said.
Hamas has sent a delegation led by its top negotiator and Gaza chief, Khalil al-Hayya, to Cairo for discussions with Egyptian officials to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, the group said in a statement. The statement added that recent meetings have centered on ensuring the full implementation of the agreement's terms, particularly the provision of shelters, the prompt delivery of prefabricated homes, tents, heavy machinery, medical supplies, fuel, and the ongoing flow of humanitarian assistance, along with all other specified provisions.Hamas earlier warned that the release of Israeli captives could be delayed due to violations of the ceasefire by the Israeli military, which has engaged in deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and restricting Palestinian movement to northern Gaza.
The truce that came into effect on January 19 has largely halted more than 15 months of genocide and seen Israeli captives released in batches in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons. But the deal has come under increasing strain with Hamas blaming Israel for failing to meet its commitments under the agreement, including on aid, and citing the deaths of three Gazans at the weekend in fresh attacks.The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in a statement on Wednesday said 801 aid trucks had entered the Palestinian territory earlier in the day “through interactions with the Israeli authorities and the guarantors for the ceasefire deal.” Despite this, OCHA cautioned that access to the war-torn region remains severely limited, with stringent restrictions on essential supplies, including fuel and medical equipment.
This comes as the Israeli regime has threatened to initiate a “new” war against Hamas, echoing US President Donald Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from the Gaza Strip unless all Israeli captives are released by Saturday. The warning came shortly after Hamas declared it would not bow down to US and Israeli threats regarding the captives' release under the fragile truce.Moreover, the al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad movement, warned Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel is responsible for the fate of captives held by the resistance in the Gaza Strip, adding that the resistance “will adhere to the ceasefire agreement in all its details as long as the enemy remains committed to it.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Rights groups call for release of Gaza’s healthcare workers abducted by Israel during war Datetime: 20250213_111100 Content: Four prominent human rights organizations have called for the release of hundreds of the Gaza Strip’s healthcare workers abducted by the Israeli regime during the genocidal war against the blockaded Palestinian territory.In a jointstatementon Wednesday, Children Not Numbers, Human Rights Watch, MedGlobal and Physicians for Human Rights - Israel urged all the parties in the Gaza ceasefire talks “to secure the release” of hundreds of essential healthcare workers from the war-torn territory who have been unlawfully detained by the Israeli military.“Physicians for Human Rights - Israel has collected testimonies revealing the severe conditions faced by detained healthcare workers, including torture, beatings, humiliation, starvation, isolation from legal representation, and incommunicado detention.
These individuals have been detained without charges and subjected to enforced disappearance, violating international law,” the statement read. The rights group stressed that these detentions have “devastated Gaza’s already decimated healthcare system”, emphasizing that releasing the abductees is a humanitarian imperative legally demanded under international humanitarian law.The detentions have crippled Gaza’s already shattered healthcare system, with over 500 medical personnel killed, the remaining staff “overwhelmed by more than 110,000 wounded civilians”, and the absence of a functional medical evaluation system exacerbating their suffering, they added, stressing that the release of detained health workers is “crucial to saving lives in Gaza's ongoing humanitarian crisis.” “Gaza's irreplaceable health workers - surgeons, pediatricians, gynecologists, obstetricians, orthopedists, and emergency responders - are vital for saving lives and sustaining essential medical services.
As hostage exchange negotiations progress, we call for unlawfully detained medical personnel to be released,” the signatories demanded. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said only half of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain partially operational.The 15-month-long Israeli genocidal war, began in October 2023, has damaged or partly destroyed nearly all hospitals and just 38 percent of primary healthcare centers are functional.An estimated 25 percent of those injured face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israeli forces kill Palestinian youth over alleged car-ramming attempt in West Bank Datetime: 20250213_141100 Content: Israeli forces have fatally shot a Palestinian youth in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, saying he attempted to carry out a car-ramming attack against the regime's troops at a checkpoint.Issa Riyad Issa Jabali, 28, was killed by Israeli troops after they opened fire at his car near the Huwara checkpoint south of Nablus on Thursday morning, the official Palestinian news agencyWAFAreported, citing Palestinian security sources.The Israeli military alleged in a statement that the young man, a resident of Beita town located 13 kilometers (8.1 miles) southeast of Nablus, was trying to ram his car into the regime's soldiers stationed at the checkpoint.Israeli troops withheld Jabali’s body after the fatal shooting.
The Israeli military launched a large-scale offensive in the West Bank on January 21, just two days after a Gaza ceasefire deal between the Tel Aviv regime and Hamas came into effect. The onslaught has resulted in the displacement of more than 35,000 Palestinians from the Jenin, Tulkarm and Far’a refugee camps.According to the United Nations, some 90 percent of the residents of the Jenin and Tulkarm refugee camps have been forced to flee.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says displacement and destruction in the Jenin camp have turned the area into a “ghost town,” while the UN human rights office says the killings and the demolition of homes “indicate ongoing violations of international law.” Since the offensive began, Israeli forces have killed dozens of Palestinians.As of February 13, WAFA news agency has documented 73 killings, including 38 in Jenin, 15 in Tubas, seven in Nablus, eight in Tulkarm, three in al-Khalil, two in Bethlehem, and one in al-Quds.
There are 10 children, three women, and two elderly people among the fatalities. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Former Israeli military general admits regime's 'absolute failure' in Gaza Datetime: 20250213_171200 Content: The architect of the Israeli regime’s so-called “Generals’ Plan” to depopulate northern Gaza has described the entity's 16-month-long war in the besieged Gaza Strip as an "absolute failure." Writing in an opinion piece forYnet, a retired major general and the plan's creator Giora Eiland said that Israel had failed to achieve its aims in the blockaded Palestinian region."Israel has failed in three-and-a-half out of the four goals of the war: we have not demolished Hamas’ military power; we have not overthrown Hamas’ rule; we are not managing to return the residents...safely to their homes [in Israel], and as for the return of the abductees, the fourth goal – we have partially succeeded," he wrote.Eiland acknowledges that Hamas has not only prevented Israel from achieving its goals but has also secured its own.
He further stressed that the Hamas movement had, conversely, "achieved all of its goals, chief among them: continuing its rule in Gaza." Eiland added that part of the problem was that the Israeli authorities had treated Hamas as purely a "terrorist" organization when it had already established state power in Gaza. Rights groups saw the original plan as part of a long-term project of ethnic cleansing that would result in the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in the blockaded Palestinian region.
The plan sought to tighten the regime’s siege against the area, cut off humanitarian aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians inside, and label those who remained there as combatants so it could target and kill them after declaring the area a "closed military zone.” The regime’s plan for the northern part of the Gaza Strip, through which it sought to starve the targeted area to advance its war goals, was already seen as “doomed to failure.” Former Israeli national security adviser Giora Eiland describes the recent war in Gaza as “a resounding failure” for Israel, acknowledging that Hamas has not only prevented Israel from achieving its goals but has also secured its ownpic.twitter.com/e3He19U4bc The vicious scheme was published by a forum of commanders and soldiers in the reserves in late September 2024.
In an interview on October 29, 2023, only weeks into the aggression, Eiland said that Israel needed to exert much stronger pressure on Hamas and other resistance groups to achieve total victory. "The fact that we are breaking down in the face of humanitarian aid to Gaza is a serious mistake...Gaza must be completely destroyed: terrible chaos, severe humanitarian crisis, cries to heaven..." And in December 2023 he suggested that if Hamas was not willing to discuss Israeli captives then humanitarian aid should be cut in the hope of ultimately deposing the Hamas leadership.There has been discussion about whether the Generals' Plan was partly underway during the Gaza war, which killed thousands of Palestinians and saw millions displaced.Israeli rights groups including Gisha, B'Tselem, Physicians for Human Rights-Israel and Yesh Din, said in October 2024 that there were "alarming signs" that the plan was being implemented.
Eiland's most recent comments come after Hamas said it would delay the release of the next tranche of Israeli captives "until further notice", accusing Israel of failing to comply with the terms of the ceasefire deal. On Tuesday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the ceasefire in Gaza would end and the military would resume fighting Hamas until it was defeated if the Palestinian resistance group did not release captives by midday February 15.Hamas later issued a statement renewing its commitment to the ceasefire and accusing Israel of jeopardizing it.Hamas has gradually been releasing captives since the first phase of a ceasefire began on January 19.But Hamas said on Monday it would not free any more captives over accusations that Israel was violating the deal.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Houthi vows Yemen’s military action if Trump’s Gaza displacement plan proceeds Datetime: 20250213_174200 Content: Yemen’s Ansarullah leader Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi has promised a “military action” if Israel or the US proceed with a plan to depopulate the Gaza Strip of its inhabitants and resettle them in other countries.“Our position concerning support for the Palestinian nation and their fighters is firm and principled, and we will resolutely stand by their side," he said in a televised speech from Yemeni capital Sana’a on Thursday."If the US succeeds in advancing its plot against Gaza, we will take military action to prevent it, and act within the framework of our religious duties.We will not sit idly by.” He added that Israel has not yet fulfilled its commitments under the Gaza ceasefire agreement by preventing the entry of aid, basic commodities and tents into the Strip.
Houthi took a swipe at the Zionist regime for violating the terms of the ceasefire in Gaza due to the encouragement of the deceitful US administration, which denies all rights. The Ansarullah chief also rejected the US president’s call for the cancellation of the Gaza ceasefire unless the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas frees all remaining Israeli captives by Saturday, stating that “Hell is for you (Donald Trump) and people of your kind like tyrants, criminals and oppressors.” Houthi emphasized that Trump’s Gaza displacement plan is more like a joke and naive talk from the president of a country that proclaims to be civilized.“Trump's plan to displace the Palestinian people from their homeland is a confiscation of a right from which many other rights are derived.
Trump is a criminal and accustomed to making careless and ridiculous remarks.” Houthi underlined that Trump's plan to displace Palestinians from Gaza reflects his insistence on the criminal plan to deny Palestinians’ rights and justice for them. “Trump's plan for Gaza is evil and cruel.It appears that he is serious about implementing the scheme, and is putting pressure on some Arab countries to accept it.We are not surprised by the US president’s plot as it shows the tyranny and criminal record of his country.There are no boundaries to the ambitions of Trump, who believes in the aggressive and unjust Zionist plan and seeks to realize it,” he stated.The Ansarullah leader stated that Trump, who unveiled the so-called “Deal of the Century” during his term in office, is now poised to perpetrate the “Crime of the Century” during his second term.
“Through his plan, Trump seeks to obtain what the Israeli aggression on Gaza failed to achieve, namely, displacing the Palestinians from their land. When the Americans raise the issue of displacing the Palestinian people from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, they seek to completely liquidate the Palestinian cause,” Houthi said.He warned that the plan to forcibly relocate Palestinians is part of the Zionist project that seeks to expand the occupying entity’s influence and is aimed at holy sites, especially the al-Aqsa Mosque.“Trump’s Gaza plan cannot succeed as long as Arabs, especially the Arab countries neighboring Palestine, do not accept it.A great responsibility lies with Arab and Muslim countries to clearly reject it, and more importantly express their vehement opposition.“The US seeks to entrap Arab regimes in a major scandal and act against the interests of their countries and peoples,” Houthi noted.
He warned that approving the American plan would have very serious consequences for the national security of Arab countries, and the entire West Asia region. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Top cleric urges Bahraini regime to heed public demands on revolution anniversry Datetime: 20250213_184000 Content: On the 14th anniversary of the popular uprising against the ruling Al Khalifah dynasty, Bahrain’s most prominent cleric Ayatollah Sheikh Isa Qassim has called on the Manama regime to take heed of public demands and grant the Arab nation the rights they have long been denied.Delivering a televised speech during a ceremony in Iran’s holy city of Qom on Thursday evening, he said Bahrainis have been deprived of their fundamental rights for decades.He said political opponents and human rights campaigners are incarcerated at the Bahraini regime’s jails and detention centers only for the sake of demanding their right to democracy and self-determination.The senior cleric also called for unity among religious groups in Bahrain, saying divisions would only benefit oppressors and those seeking to suppress them.
Anti-monarchy demonstrations began in Bahrain on February 14, 2011, and have been held regularly ever since the popular uprising started. Demonstrators demand that the Al Khalifah regime relinquish power, and a democratic, just system representing all Bahrainis be established.The Manama regime, however, has responded to demands for social equality with an iron fist, clamping down on voices of dissent.In March 2017, Bahrain’s parliament approved the trial of opposition civilians at military tribunals in a measure blasted by human rights campaigners as being tantamount to the imposition of an undeclared martial law.The monarch, King Hamad, ratified the constitutional amendment in April 2017, bringing about further suppression of political dissent on the tiny Persian Gulf Island under the strong influence of the Saudi regime.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues despite ceasefire: UN Datetime: 20250213_184400 Content: The head of the United Nations infrastructure agency has warned that a humanitarian catastrophe continues in the Gaza Strip despite a ceasefire agreement that brought a "much-needed respite." Jorge Moreira da Silva, head of the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), made a warning following a visit to the besieged Gaza Strip where a truce between Israel and Hamas has been in effect since January 19."In addition to immense human suffering, I also witnessed an unimaginable degree of the destruction of infrastructure and houses, and an overwhelming volume of rubble," da Silva was quoted as saying.The ceasefire suspended Israel's genocidal war that has killed more than 48,200 people, mostly women and children, and left the besieged strip in ruins.
The lack of aid before the ceasefire agreement had devastating effects on the people of Gaza, who endured critical food insecurity and the prospect of famine. The situation has been particularly dire in the north of Gaza, where humanitarian access significantly deteriorated since September 2024.In a statement, the Hamas resistance group said a delegation headed by top negotiator Khalil al-Haya, held talks with the mediators to review the process of implementing the agreement.It added that the negotiating team emphasized the implementation of all provisions, especially the delivery of shelters, prefabricated houses, tents, heavy equipment, medical supplies, fuel and humanitarian aid to Gaza.Hamas spokesperson Abdul Latif al-Qanou also pointed out that the group's mediators are exerting pressure to complete the full implementation of the agreement, obliging Israel to abide by the humanitarian protocol and resume the prisoner-captive exchange process on Saturday.
He stressed that the language of threats and intimidation used by US President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu does not serve the interests of the implementation of the ceasefire. Hamas earlier announced that it would postpone the exchange due to Israeli violations of the deal.Israel has reportedly promised to put in place a humanitarian protocol starting this morning.This comes as mediators, Egypt and Qatar say they have overcome Gaza truce obstacles.Hamas has now confirmed it would implement the Gaza ceasefire deal and will release more Israeli captives as scheduled on Saturday.Israel has turned Gaza into the world's largest open-air prison, maintaining an 18-year blockade and forcing nearly 2 million of its 2.3 million residents into displacement amid dire shortages of food, water, and medicine due to deliberate restrictions.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Hamas: Efforts underway to remove all obstacles to implement ceasefire deal Datetime: 20250213_233600 Content: The Hamas resistance movement has reiterated that it is ready to implement the Gaza ceasefire deal, including the exchange of prisoners, per the text of the agreement.The resistance movement said on Thursday that the latest round of talks in Cairo has been positive and efforts are underway to remove all the obstacles to implementing the agreement.“The talks were held in a positive atmosphere, with Egyptian and Qatari mediators reaffirming their commitment to addressing obstacles and filling gaps to ensure implementation.Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to the agreement as signed, including the prisoner exchange process according to the specified timeline,” the statement said.
Hamas stressed that the language of threat and intimidation used by US President Donald Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not serve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. The resistance movement said in the statement that a Hamas delegation, led by Dr.Khalil Al-Hayya, head of Hamas in Gaza and chief negotiator, “held discussions with the esteemed mediators to review the implementation of the ceasefire and prisoner exchange agreement, particularly in light of continuous ‘Israeli’ violations.” “The delegation convened a meeting in Cairo with Lieutenant General Hassan Rashad, Head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Service, and held phone discussions with His Excellency Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar,” it stated.
The resistance movement also said that the delegation also held meetings and discussions with officials overseeing the negotiations in Egypt and Qatar, as well as with technical teams from the mediators monitoring the full implementation of the agreement. “All discussions and communications focused on the necessity of adhering to all provisions of the agreement, particularly ensuring the urgent delivery of shelter for our people, including prefabricated homes (caravans), tents, heavy machinery, medical supplies, fuel, and the continued flow of humanitarian aid as stipulated in the agreement,” it added.Meanwhile, senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said the pressure from Gaza ceasefire mediators on Israel has led to the regime’s renewed commitment to the terms of the truce deal.He made the remarks after the movement said an obstacle in the Gaza captive exchange process has been removed and the next round of prisoner swap will take place on Saturday.
He added that Hamas is ready to begin negotiations on the second phase of the agreement next Monday. Hamdan also said, "We have 48 hours to hand over the captives, and any obstruction by the occupation to the entry of caravans and heavy equipment into Gaza will lead to action by Hamas." Israel has turned Gaza into the world's largest open-air prison, maintaining an 18-year blockade and forcing nearly 2 million of its 2.3 million residents into displacement amid dire shortages of food, water, and medicine due to deliberate restrictions.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Lebanese protest cancellation of two scheduled civilian flights from Iran to Lebanon Datetime: 20250214_010800 Content: A large number of people have taken to the streets around Beirut’s International Airport to protest the cancellation of two scheduled civilian flights from Iran to Lebanon.On Thursday night, protesters blocked the entrance to the airport and the international road leading to it, setting tires alight while chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans.The demonstrators set fire to tires, creating roadblocks, while tensions rose during clashes with Lebanese military personnel who attempted to clear the route.The cancellation was ordered by the Lebanese Roads Minister under pressure from the Zionist regime, which claimed that the plane was transferring funds to the Hezbollah resistance movement.
Iran’s Mahan Air was reportedly informed that a flight scheduled to arrive in Beirut from Tehran would not receive the necessary permission to land, resulting in the cancellation of the trip. An official at Beirut’s airport toldAFPthat the Public Works and Transport ministry had asked the facility to inform Mahan Air that Lebanon could not welcome two of its Beirut-bound flights.The official who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters said one flight was scheduled for Thursday and another for Friday.Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called for immediate measures to bring the stranded Lebanese passengers back to Beirut.A pro-resistance lawmaker condemned the decision, stating that the government must take necessary measures to guarantee Lebanon’s sovereignty over all its public facilities, especially the airport.
Ebrahim Mousavi, a member of the Lebanese Parliament, said the Israeli regime's violations of Lebanese sovereignty and the complicity of the international community, especially the United States, have led to the regime's further arrogance. “These actions are strongly condemned, and everyone in Lebanon must loudly denounce them and force the responsible international institutions to take action,” he stated.Mousavi said that the Lebanese people “expect the government to take the necessary measures to establish its sovereignty over all public centers, especially Rafik Hariri International Airport.” “The Zionist enemy must not be allowed to imagine that it can encroach on Lebanese sovereignty at any time,” he stated.
The lawmaker went on to say that the “Lebanese government, with all its institutions, must assume responsibility and pave the way for the rapid return of citizens from Iran, without giving in to Israeli threats.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Vatican: Palestinians must 'stay on their land' Datetime: 20250214_025000 Content: A top Vatican official has rejected US President Donald Trump's displacement plan, saying "the Palestinian population must remain on its land." "This is one of the fundamental points of the Holy See: no deportations," Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said on Thursday on the sidelines of an Italy-Vatican meeting.He added that moving Palestinians out would cause regional tensions and "makes no sense" as neighboring countries such as Jordan are opposed."The solution in our opinion is that of two states because this also means giving hope to the population," he said.This is not the first time the Vatican opposes Trump’s policies.Pope Francis this week criticized Trump's plans for mass deportations of undocumented migrants in the United States, drawing a sharp response.In a letter to US bishops, the head of the Catholic Church called the deportations a major crisis.
It said sending back people who had fled their own countries in distress "damages the dignity" of the migrants. This came amid uproar caused by Trump’s call to take over the besieged Gaza Strip and relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries.Trump has repeatedly stated that Jordan and Egypt will take in Palestinians from the blockaded Palestinian region, an idea that Amman and Cairo have flatly rejected.The US president has suggested that he could deny aid to Jordan and Egypt if they didn't accept his proposal.“If they don’t agree, I would conceivably withhold aid.” Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israeli warplanes launch airstrikes against southern Lebanon in violation of ceasefire Datetime: 20250214_064600 Content: Israeli military aircraft have carried out a series of airstrikes, targeting several areas in the southern side of Lebanon in a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement with the Arab country.Lebanon's private LBCI television station reported that the warplanes targeted localities near the Litani River, including the towns of Yohmor al-Shaqif and Zoutr al-Sharqiya, on Thursday night.The Israeli fighter jets also struck the municipalities of Deir Siryan, Zibqin and Yater.There were no immediate reports about possible causalities or the extent of damage caused.Hours later, the Israeli military said in a statement that its strikes targeted “military sites containing weapons and launchers” belonging to Hezbollah resistance movement.
After experiencing substantial losses during almost 14 months of hostilities and not accomplishing its objectives in its offensive against Lebanon, Israel had no choice but to accept a ceasefire with Hezbollah. The truce came into effect on November 27.Since the start of the agreement though, the occupation forces have been conducting near-daily attacks on Lebanon in violation of the ceasefire, including airstrikes across the Arab nation.On January 10, Lebanon lodged a formal complaint with the UN Security Council regarding Israeli acts of aggression targeting agricultural lands and livestock in the southern region of the country, in violation of the truce agreement.Hezbollah has placed the responsibility on the Lebanese government to guarantee the complete withdrawal of Israeli military forces from southern Lebanon.On January 27, Lebanon announced its agreement to extend the ceasefire with Israel until February 18.
This decision came despite the Israeli military's failure to adhere to a deadline for troop withdrawal and the reported fatalities of nearly two dozen individuals in the southern region of the country. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Israel bombs homes in Jenin as Palestine urges intl.action against West Bank aggression Datetime: 20250214_072200 Content: Israel has conducted a fresh drone attack on the Jenin refugee camp, as the Palestinian foreign ministry urges the international community to take a serious action to stop the regime’s intensified aggression on the occupied West Bank.In the early hours of Friday, media reports said an Israeli drone targeted homes in the Jenin camp in the northern part of the West Bank.Since a ceasefire in Gaza was announced last month, Israel has intensified its attacks in Jenin and other parts of the occupied West Bank.At least 25 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s raids in Jenin this year, which have also displaced nearly 20,000, according to the camp’s media committee.The Israeli army also continues to destroy homes and infrastructure in the West Bank city of Tulkarm and its two camps.
According to the Tulkarm Camp’s Media Committee, nine people have been killed, and about 10,500 others --around 80 percent of its population -- have been displaced since Israeli forces began the assault on the camp. Video footage showed Israeli bulldozers destroying homes in Tulkarm’s Nour Shams Refugee Camp on Thursday.The Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) said at least 380 people have been detained by Israeli forces since the start of their large-scale military raids in the West Bank after the Gaza ceasefire went into effect on January 19.The deal between Israel and Hamas was reached after 15 months of the regime's genocidal war on the strip, which claimed the lives of at least 48,239 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 111,676 others.
The regime agreed to the ceasefire after falling short of realizing any of its wartime objectives, including freeing the captives, “eliminating” the Gazan resistance, and causing forced displacement of Gaza’s entire population to neighboring Egypt or Jordan. The Palestinian Foreign ministry on Thursday urged the international community to take “an urgent and effective action” to force Israel to stop its aggression on the West Bank.Referring to Israeli crimes in the occupied territories, including the forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes and the destruction of homes and infrastructure, the ministry said the international silence emboldens Israel to commit more crimes and enables it to continue its crime of ethnic cleansing.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Lebanon rejects Israeli plan to stay in country's south beyond withdrawal deadline Datetime: 20250214_095900 Content: Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri says Lebanon has categorically dismissed Israel’s plan to remain in five locations in the country's south beyond the next week's withdrawal deadline under a ceasefire deal.Berri made the remarks on Thursday after the US administration indicated that it supports the Israeli occupation forces remaining in five strategic positions in southern Lebanon after the February 18 pull-out deadline.Washington "informed me that the Israeli occupation will withdraw from villages it still occupies on February 18, but it will remain in five points," he told reporters, according to a statement released by his office."I informed them in my name and on behalf of President General Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Judge Nawaf Salam of our absolute rejection" of the proposal, he added.
Lebanon's Hezbollah resistance movement opened a support front for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip after Israel unleashed a genocidal war on the besieged territory on October 7, 2023, launching numerous retaliatory attacks against targets in the occupied lands. Israel was forced to accept thetrucewith Hezbollah on November 27, 2024, after suffering heavy losses on the battleground and failing to achieve its goals despite killing over 4,000 people in Lebanon.The deal gave Israel until January 26 to pull out its forces from Lebanon's occupied areas, but the deadline was extended to February 18 after Israel refused to comply with the agreement.Berri said, “If the Israeli occupation persists in South Lebanon, days will tell.The Lebanese state is responsible for that." Earlier, Berri met with US Ambassador to Lebanon Lisa Johnson and US Major General Jasper Jeffers.The top Lebanese parliamentarian said he had refused to discuss any extension to the deadline for Israel’s withdrawal.
“It is the responsibility of the Americans to enforce the withdrawal, otherwise, they will have caused the greatest setback for the government," he emphasized. He also warned that the continuation of the Israeli occupation of Lebanese soil is "completely unacceptable” as Hezbollah is "fully committed" to the ceasefire.Since the truce began, Israel has violated it by launching attacks on Lebanon that killed and injured several people.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: UN envoy warns about US terror designation of Yemen's Ansarullah Datetime: 20250214_100200 Content: UN Special Envoy for Yemen Hans Grundberg has warned about negative effects of the US designation of Yemen’s Ansarullah resistance movement as a foreign terror organization over their retaliatory attacks on Israeli targets.“While clarifications are sought regarding the upcoming US designation of Ansarullah as a foreign terrorist organization, it is important that our efforts to advance the peace process are protected,” Grundberg told the Security Council on Thursday.Last month, US President Donald Trump re-designated Ansarullah as a "foreign terrorist organization," the White House said, following its attacks on Israeli-occupied territories, assaults on US Navy warships and Israel-linked vessels in the region, since the Gaza war in October 2023.
The decree relisting Yemen’s resistance movement as a terrorist organization directs the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to terminate its affiliations with organizations that have provided financial support to the group or resisted initiatives aimed at combating it. Under the new directive, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is required to report to the president within 30 days, after consulting with the director of National Intelligence and the secretary of the Treasury, on the designation of Ansarullah in accordance with US law.Following this report, appropriate actions must be taken within 15 days.Grundberg stressed that lasting peace in Yemen is “achievable," adding that the parties must engage in good faith and take the necessary steps to turn commitments into reality.“Only a political settlement of the conflict will support the Yemenis in their aspirations for lasting peace.It is achievable, it is possible, and it is pragmatic,” he emphasized.
Grundberg noted that a sustainable political resolution will help improve Yemen’s economic situation. “These hardships are symptoms of the failure to achieve a sustainable political resolution.Without the prospect of peace, there can be no prosperity,” he said.Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with its Arab allies and with arms and logistics support from the US and other Western states, launched the devastating war on Yemen in March 2015.The objective was to crush Ansarullah, which has been running state affairs in the absence of a functional government in Yemen and reinstall the Riyadh-friendly regime of Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi.The Saudi-led coalition failed to achieve any of its objectives in the war that killed hundreds of thousands of Yemenis and spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.A UN-mediated ceasefire in Yemen broke down in October 2022, six months after it went into effect.
Nevertheless, tensions have eased and casualties have decreased as important elements of the truce apparently remain in place. Describing the situation in West Asia as “significant, albeit fragile” amid the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, Grundberg said, “We have also seen a cessation of attacks by Ansarullah on vessels in the Red Sea and targets in Israel.” He also hailed as positive the release by Ansarullah fighters of the crew members of the Galaxy Leader vessel, saying, “We must build on this opportunity as a foundation for further de-escalation." After the onset of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Yemeni forces carried out scores of operations in support of the war-hit Gazans, striking targets throughout the occupied Palestinian territories, in addition to targeting Israeli ships or vessels heading towards ports in the occupied territories.
Last month, Yemen's Supreme Political Council “announced the freeing of the crew of the Galaxy Leader, who were arrested on November 19, 2023." It said the move came “in support of the ceasefire" that took hold in Gaza on January 19. The deal between Israel and Hamas was reached after 15 months of the regime's genocidal war on the strip, which claimed the lives of at least 48,239 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 111,676 others.The regime was compelled to accept the ceasefire after falling short of realizing any of its wartime objectives, including freeing the captives, “eliminating” the Gazan resistance, and causing forced displacement of Gaza’s entire population to neighboring Egypt.Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
Title: Yemenis hold mass rallies in solidarity with Palestine, Axis of Resistance Datetime: 20250214_110900 Content: Tens of thousands of people have staged mass rallies in Yemen’s northwestern province of Sa’ada, reiterating their unflinching stance in support of the people of Palestine, their legitimate cause as well as the Axis of Resistance.According to Yemen’s al-Masirah television channel, Yemenis held demonstrations in dozens of districts and regions across the province, including Majz, Ghamr, al-Dhaher, Baqim, Kitaf wa al-Boqe'e, al-Hashwah, Monabbih and Qatabir, on Friday, expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of Palestine, and condemned the US president’s plan to take over Gaza and relocate Palestinians to neighboring countries like Jordan and Egypt.The demonstrators waved flags of Palestine and Yemen, while chanting slogans in denunciation of Donald Trump’s Gaza displacement scheme.
They also chanted slogans in support of the Yemeni Ansarullah movement and other forces of the Axis of Resistance. In their slogans, the demonstrators emphasized that they are not afraid of the United States and Israel, and will not allow the fiendish plot to proceed.Houthi to Trump: Gaza displacement plan will fail During the massive rally in the provincial capital of Sa’ada, Mohammad Ali al-Houthi, a member of Yemen's Supreme Political Council, addressed the US president, saying, “Your military power and the support you offered to the occupier (Israel) will not force the Palestinian people to leave their homeland.” He stressed that Yemen stands by Palestine, and the US will witness the full extent of the Yemeni military prowess – something it hasn’t experienced so far.“The missiles and forces you dispatched to Palestinian territories will fail to displace the people of Gaza.
Your statements will not materialize, and will not manage to force the Yemeni nation into abandoning their position,” Houthi said. He stressed that Yemeni people and their armed forces are on alert closely monitoring the unfolding developments.The senior Yemeni official also pointed to the collision of the US aircraft carrier USS Harry S.Truman with a large merchant vessel on Wednesday night in the Mediterranean Sea, saying the incident exposes the anxiety and distress that the US Navy is enduring as a result of battles with the Yemeni armed forces.He stated that all options are on the table, and Yemeni armed forces stand fully prepared for any possible scenario, especially after recent remarks by Ansarulalh leader Abul-Malik al-Houthi that Yemen will intervene, even militarily, if the US and Israel attempt to enforce the Gaza displacement plan by force or collude with Arab regimes to implement it.
Houthi reiterated Yemeni people's support for the Palestinian nation for the past 15 months, adding that their million-man marches attest to such a stance. Press TV’s website can also be accessed at the following alternate addresses: www.presstv.co.uk
